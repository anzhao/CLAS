00:02:50,"Claire Launchbury",annotation,student,,"INteresting to include discussion in large-scale lecture format...."
----,"Marcus De Leeuw",comment,student,,"Main thing which I recognize is the relation between process and content whereby the process is at least as important as the content. To keep students engaged you most come up with new formats and enable identification and discussion. It is very time-consuming because you always need to come up with new clips, discussion questions and learning formats."
----,"Ali Akbar Nezhad",comment,student,"General Comments - Ali","The importance of process has been well-emphasized. The process is at least as important as the content and deserves great deal of attention. When implementing your planned process, it is very important to be flexible. Lecturers should not force the planned process.  Allowing students to own the discussion and contribute to the process enhances contribution and learning. Using a simple clip or example especially in the beginning of the lecture is an effective way to help students understand the key concepts, importance of the lecture and possible applications."
00:00:42,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I like the workshop idea and flexibility in teaching. Also the idea of constantly trying new things and reacting to how the audience react to these things."
00:03:16,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"Plan your activities and make sure it aligns with the outcomes and aims for the session and course in general. I find this important to remember in my course for the future. Very interesting."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,,"I think the message I take from this is that you should plan your activities, but be flexible enough to adapt to the needs of the audience and the content. I like the idea of using some of the tools that you use in a workshop environment and adapting that to a large group. I think the use of examples and real life cases are good ways to engage the students and give them something topical to discuss. Overall insightful and a good example."
00:00:19,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"'effective process feeds content' - one is not useful without the other."
00:00:35,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of treating lectures like a workshop - it feels less authoritarian/hierarchical and more community-based."
00:01:17,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"This idea of being 'in tune' with the students sits well for me - sometimes lectures risk losing the audience, or at least leaving people behind. Getting feedback and participation along the way ensures that people can keep up and are on the same wavelength."
00:02:30,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"The casual style is great (walking and talking) but you would have to really know your content back to front, be able to ad lib and be confident in not referring to your notes."
00:03:00,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"I'm definitely a fan of audio visual materials to keep people awake and engaged!"
00:02:42,"Alex Baumber",annotation,student,,"I often take a similar approach but I tend to give more guidance in what I want them to discuss - and also tell them how long they have and what is expected when we stop the one-on-one discussion."
----,"Alex Baumber",comment,student,,"I like his lecturing style and attempt to do much of this myself. Partly it comes down to personality though. I wouldn't engage with the students in quite the same way as him. Also, I find videos and other discussion activities are helpful in stopping me from talking too much and slowing down the pace of the class, as I can often end up going too fast if I'm left alone up the front talking for too long..."
00:00:54,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Prof. Carabetta shows how he has become more conscious of his teaching practice. Whist at the beginning of his career as a lecturer his main focus was on content rather than on process, now he talks how he has moved from content to effective process, that means signicant learning. His lectures now look like large workshops and students seem to be directly involved. He feels more relaxed and seems to enjoy teaching more."
00:00:57,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"We can see the interactive nature of his workshop-like lectures, how he conducts discussions, asks for opinions, evaluates personal contributions and self-reflecions, etc"
00:03:04,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Incorporating Youtube significant videos to fuel discussion seems to be a very effective teaching strategy to motivate students. They feel free to express their own opinions in small groups, they learn to listen each others and to take in turns offering their personal contributes"
00:02:49,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Prof. Carabetta underlines the fact that we all learn in a different way and that choosing an activity as simple as a youtube clip can represent a very good personalised learning experience"
00:03:11,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"He also advises that we should always have a back up actvity in case something gets wrong. He also points out the fact that we should be willing to take the risk of dealing with incertainty and stay cool in case we need to choose option B."

00:02:57,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of getting the students to briefly discuss things during the lecture. It gives the lecturer a break and brings back the students who might have stopped paying attention."
----,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",comment,student,,"As a lecturer you have to be quite confident and know your material really well to do this. You need to be well prepared and as he said needs to have a backup if things don&rsquo;t work out. I think it might take a while for the students to get used to it because they aren&rsquo;t used to that kind of learning but if the lecturer keeps at it, students will start to enjoy it as well."
00:00:21,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Giuseppe claims that &lsquo;effective process feeds content&rsquo;. This is an interesting point. However, no matter how sophisticated the process happens to be, without having relevant and well-perceived content, it is utterly useless. I would probably say that having a good content permits the lecturer to work out novel, more engaging processes to present the lecture."
00:00:27,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Treating each lecture as a large workshop is an interesting idea. It may be useful with certain topics but I am unsure that it would be appropriate to deliver each and every lecture in this large workshop format."
00:00:47,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of being relaxed and flexible. I agree that the communication with students benefits from this attitude; students will be less hesitant when asking questions or participating in the special activities."
00:01:34,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I very much agree that having video (Youtube) samples in the lectures is a useful and powerful tool. It makes lectures more engaging."
00:03:24,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Having a Plan B is an absolute must have if this type of lecturing is performed. One must have a contingency plan and perhaps revert back to the old-style lectures if students are not willing to participate in a way they should."
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"Activity-like lectures are interesting, and they provide an alternative way to deliver lecture material. Although I do not think that this arrangement can be employed for each and every lecture, activity-like lectures certainly make the teaching process more exciting and engaging. Presenting Youtube or other demonstrative videos during the lectures is also an excellent technique to maintain students&rsquo; interest and ensure their active participation. Importantly, however, one must have a contingency plan to deal with the situation when students do not cooperate well enough."
00:00:21,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,"Effective process feeds content","""Effect process feeds content""...a good point. I think selecting and fine tuning the process has a number of variables to play with: the content, background of the students (both educations and cultural), and sometimes on may be any follow-up courses continuing in later years in the curriculum."
00:00:45,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Seminar-like activity-based lectures are really cool and it really helps to keep the audience with you till at the very end."
00:01:52,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Examples that can be related to personal experiences are more engaging."
00:02:45,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Group activities are always engaging, and as a student I really enjoy those. However, the content and limited time within the semester are always imposing constraints on implementing frequent group activities. In Electrical Engineering, mostly the lectures are accompanied by labs and tutorials, where group activities are frequently used. In this context, lectures are meant to squeeze a lot of content into 12-15 weeks, which makes it practically difficult to increase engagement."
00:03:21,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Back-up options, a must to remember"
----,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",comment,student,,"The video highlights about careful planning and selection of the right process for the content being taught, and also highlights activity-based seminar-like lectures with enhanced student engagement. Of course, such an approach requires a lot of preparation, back-up plans, and might need to compromise the content to find time."
00:00:26,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"Treating a lecture as a large workshop is an interesting idea. The challenge is how to conduct &ldquo;the workshop&rdquo; effectively as a chair."
00:01:18,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"&ldquo;In tune with audience&rdquo; is surely important but may be difficult. To do this, the lecture should be highly interactive."
00:03:25,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I have never thought preparing a backup option for a lecture. It would be very good when taking a risk in the lecture, although it means that I should spend more time to prepare a lecture.."
----,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",comment,student,,"I agree that processes of teaching are important as well as contents of teaching. What I mainly felt from the video are that a lecture should be highly interactive with students and a lecturer should make good preparations. To engage students, I should make a lecture interactive, make students have group discussions, include interesting and practical topics, and so on. But these actually mean taking a risk. Students may not be interested nor engaged as I expected. So the important point is that I need good preparations which must include a backup plan to conduct a successful lecture."
00:00:21,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","When you have taught the same topic many times in various ways you quickly learn that students engage with the content on a deeper level if the way they learn is engaging"
00:01:20,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Being able to check that the students understand the key learning objectives as the lecture proceeds validates the interactive style of lecturing"
00:02:51,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","This method of engaging students will help the majority, but the quiet students or the underperforming students may still be too intimidated to interact with the other students and lecturers"
00:03:22,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","if technology fails, especially videos playing, the session is never quite the same! Having backup smooths this over"
----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","Its always worth attempting to improve your learning activities and seeking feedback about whether the concepts have been conveyed well to the students. Constant modification and improvement, along with a flexible attitude on the day, especially if it fails, should engage the students more"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"I tip my hat to Prof Carabetta! He demonstrates great skill in managing the give-and-take of a seminar in a traditional classroom setting. Interacting with students, posing discussion questions, going with the natural flow of the lecture: he makes it look easy! But in fact, it requires considerable mastery to steer a lecture like this towards your learning goals. Interactive activities and video clips (and back-up plans!) are a great way of guiding your students through complex content in an engaging way. How can I bring this kind of guided discussion to my own lectures?"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,YouTube,"I make use of YouTube quite a bit in my lectures as a way of demonstrating abstract concepts applied to real-world systems. It's a great way to reinforce a point visually, provide a different perspective, and also to give the students a much-needed break from my voice! That said, YouTube clips are generally low-quality video and audio that doesn't always play well over the lecture room AV system. And the ads and pop-ups are distracting and annoying. And of course there is the issue of copyright infringement. Are there other resources for video clips that avoid these issues?"
00:00:26,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"workshop flexibility","I have found the idea of a workshop as opposed to a lecture a more engaging experience for myself and the students. In teaching creative design subjects I have found mixing the content of a lecture and tutorial allows students to gather new experiences in their learning."
00:00:45,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"relaxed open flexible","Being relaxed, open and flexible yourself permits the students to respond in a similar manner."
00:03:04,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"YouTube samples","I have found that combining lecture slides, YouTube videos and actual physical samples that the students can see and touch reinforces the concepts I am presenting to them. The physical samples automatically engages the students in conversations amongst themselves and discussion/questions directed towards me."
00:01:01,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,relaxed,"I think being relaxed is important when you are delivering any sort of training."
00:02:58,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"Adding activities like videos can definitely improve engagement with your audience"
----,"Melinda Chylinski",comment,student,,"I think it is important that you are able to reflect on things that work and things that do not work when delivering any training session. And it is also important to get feedback from the participants as you might feel something worked well when the participants may not have felt the same way."
----,"Gregory Martens",comment,student,"Learning in different ways","The workshop environment that is adopted in this teaching method resonates strongly with me. For me, teaching a technical/creative design subject requires many different resources and planning to engage the students. I also find that sharing actual physical samples also allows them to learn and understand in their own way. ""A sample can be with a thousand words"". Everybody learns in a different way."
00:03:13,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Aligning Process and Goal","I think this is a very important point: make sure that the activity aligns with what you are trying to achieve. I have come to this same conclusion whilst watching several of the other videos shown in this FULT course."

----,"Kavitha Suthanthiraraj",comment,student,null,"I appreciate the relaxed and interactive approach illustarted through this video. The use of relevant class activities (videos) to enagage the students and start an interactive dialogue was also a great teaching technique."
