00:01:14,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I'm most convinced by the argument that many students will learn the content of a lecture better (and deeper) if they have the option to start and stop a lecture recording as required, rather than having to try to keep up while sitting in a lecture theatre!"
00:01:46,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of starting each lecture with an open quiz to get people engaged and ready for the session!"
00:02:00,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"As a lecturer in a big course, who doesn't run any tutorials myself, I'm very much attracted to the option of getting more direct connections with a greater number of students, through the flipped classroom model."
00:02:36,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Great ideas about how to share responses - by identifying those groups most likely to be most interesting/different and actively asking them to share, you avoid the issue of students being unwilling to share their ideas in case they look silly."
00:03:35,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Amazing to think of all the possibilities afforded by recording group activities in lecture sessions, so students can access them later!"
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"I've heard a little about flipped classrooms before, but this video has given me lots of concrete ideas about what is possible through this approach, I really like it! It's a bit daunting to think about the work required to set it up, recording the (short) videos beforehand, for example, but the benefits for student learning are clear, and I think the students I teach would really love it. Lots of things for me to think about now in terms of restructuring my course for next year..."
00:01:27,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"Cutting down","It's interesting to hear that the traditional lecture was cut down from 50 mins to 12-15 mins. What content was cut out? Was this content used during the flipped classroom time?"
00:02:03,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"Lecture theatre design","It's interesting to see that although the flipped classroom is being used, the room itself is not equipped to handle the group work. What sort of things can lecturers do to make the most of the current spaces provided for giving lectures?"
00:03:02,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,filming,"I like the idea of getting students to contribute their ideas to the rest of the cohort, but what about considerations for students who would like to contribute but are not necessarily comfortable being filmed? It makes me think of what I could do to get the quieter ones more involved in class discussion, whilst not making them feel like they are being isolated for being quiet."
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,"flipped classroom","The flipped classroom is certainly more dynamic. Having been a student in one course that employs it, it does force you to think much more critically about the content. I would still like to know about more ways to include quieter students in discussion without making them feel isolated. ie. how can the flipped classroom be made more inclusive rather than just providing an outlet for the most vocal students?"
00:00:19,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Right off the bat, I am not sure how relevant this is to my current teaching practice, as I only teach small groups (usually around 20-30 students, at any rate capped at 44). But I've taught big lectures in the past, so, we'll see."
00:01:02,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Yes, the lecture time is cut down, but I would think part of the ""efficiency"" is because there is no time for discussions anymore.And maybe it's a lack of student conditioning for this model, but, in my flipped classroom experience, students who do not understand a concept in the video are unlikely to make a note of the question and bring it to class for discussion.I don't know, I think I'm too much of a control freak to assume that any questions a student might have will resolve themselves inside the small group, during the activity."
00:01:53,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of adding a timer to the screen, I don't know why I hadn't done that before."
00:03:03,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"So, what is the rest of the class supposed to do while the few students are recording their videos? I missed that step."
----,"Lucas Lixinski",comment,student,,"It's certainly an interesting approach to flipped classrooms. We have been experimenting with some of that at the Law Faculty, and I've been involved in some flipped classroom course design. We do things a bit differently, because our groups are quite a bit smaller, but I can see a lot of similarities, too.One thing that particularly struck me about the video is the notion that all student questions can be answered if the student is able to slow down and rewind the video. From my experience, very often the information just needs to be conveyed in a different way, and, while the classroom might be an opportunity to do just that, the video didn't seem to convey there would be much space for group discussion of issues raised in the videos, just individual consultations at the end of class."
