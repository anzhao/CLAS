----,"Anne Lonie",comment,student,,"Judging by the video and some other articles I have looked at, the main problem seems to be ""excessive flexibility"" in the face of significant aerodynamic forces.  Glad I wasn&rsquo;t on it at the time!"
----,"Sue Lefebvre",comment,student,"More information about the event","For more detail to assist you in answering the question regarding why the construction continued even though the swaying/uplift occurred during construction, the following link will help:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)"
00:00:21,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"Forces to create this swaying are spectacular"
00:01:28,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"To think that this was filmed in 1940 is awesome but I guess they knew it was coming since it was a windy day and had swayed previously."
----,"Sue Lefebvre",comment,student,,"Can anybody find out why the construction wasn't stopped, assessed and the bridge redesigned even though what was constructed was a very bad (in retrospect) alteration to the original design?"
00:02:22,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"Those lightpoles were attached well."
00:02:00,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"Very brave man."
----,"Sue Lefebvre",comment,student,,"I found the music accompaniment a bit weird. Though a sad event for Tubby the dog the oscillating and flexing was beautiful to see."
----,"Philip Dunbar",comment,student,"Phil Dunbar","Very Interesting to watch, The amount of osculation in the bridge when it really starts to move is amazing to watch, In relation to why they continued to build the bridge, this bridge was built on a reduced budget, potentially to make it viable on a proposed design. As the bridge was being built there were attempts makes to stop the movement in the bridge that had been noted by the worker on the bridge while construction was progressing. However none of there were successful. Thanks for the interesting link on this bridge Sue, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940), Information was reviewed on the 20/10/2014."
