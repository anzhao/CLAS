00:01:28,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"Pace of lecture","Allowing review of the lecture is a great way of consolidating learning."
----,"Penelope Uther",comment,student,"Efficiency of flipped classroom","It is important to bear in mind any increase in workload for the teacher and the student- the pre-session work may only be a small portion (in time) of what it is replacing.  The flipped classroom has the ability to make sessions more individualised and tailored.  1 - Students can work through the presession activity at their own pace, and 2 - I can interact with small groups rather than a giant group."

00:02:50,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"Would we need to get ethics approval before we can record students in a situation like this?"
----,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",comment,student,,"I personally see the flipped class room working well in a tutorial or a practical class rather than a lecture. The smaller number of students would make discussion aspects easier. Having a repository of student responses or ideas that are recorded is a great idea because showing that their contributions are useful or important in learning would make them feel more confident."
00:01:24,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Large amounts of pre-work for multiple sessions within a course may overburden students. If they don't complete the pre-work the quiz and group exercise would fail, and students may not attend the session."

----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","The flipped classroom model has obvious advantages -- students attend class with knowledge/skills already learned, and are tested on this with a quiz motivating them to do the pre-work. There is more interaction, both with each other and the lecturer which will raise the standard of the under performing students. Students can review live aspects of the lecturer afterwards from their own responses which will be memorable, and reflections more meaningful."

----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,,"Flipped classroom using pre-recorded video lecture reduces lecture time by a quarter or a half. The open note quiz is done by students when the actual class starts - however not clear to me how it is carried out to assess students have watched and understood the video lecture?There are discussion questions in groups with responses of key groups recorded.Benefits claimed are that students can publish their own critical thoughts and can reflect on them.I do wonder about the loss of the immediacy of being able to ask a question immediately while a lecture is being given. Under the flipped system the student would have to write it down to ask later."
00:00:44,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"content of videos","I wonder what type of content is in this video. Hopefully it's engaging and interesting rather that a dry lecture."
00:01:23,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,video,"It's great the students can slow this down and review it at their own pace."
00:02:01,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"class interaction","I LOVE the idea of the lecturer speaking with individual groups and circulating throughout the classroom. In large classrooms it's so hard to interact with individual students."
00:02:51,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"recroding students","I wonder how the students felt about being recorded."
----,"Toni Ferrara",comment,student,"Toni Ferrara","I can see the advantages of the flipped classroom approach and I love the idea of the lecturer being able to interact with individuals in a large classroom. I don't think the pre-recorded videos just have to be a lecturer presenting material they could instead include videos on topics as well, such as animations. One main issue however, is how will busy academics find time to build these resources. Many academics are currently judged largely on their research outputs with teaching considered something that you just do as part of your job description.  Until UNSW as an institution rewards quality teaching, making it a key aspect of the promotions process, few academics will be encouraged to put the effort into flipped classrooms that is required. UNSW needs to consider teaching only positions in order to optimize teaching and research outputs."
00:01:06,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I fail to see how the lecture time could be halved by (simply) pre-recording it. I find it difficult to believe that just because the lecture is pre-recorded and the speaker can talk as fast as he wishes, the duration of the entire lecture is halved. Something does not add up here for me."
00:01:31,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,": I think one of the benefits of live lectures is interaction. The speaker maintains contact with the class and responds if (s)he feels that a thought did not make sense to the audience. I do not very much like the idea that I could talk to a recorder instead, without any sort of speaker-audience interaction."
00:02:01,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"So, the technique effectively is that the lecture is converted to a multi-group seminar discussion. I am not sure that I see the benefit of this. What happens to the conventional seminar discussions in this setting?"
00:03:20,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Most speakers would take questions anyway at the end of the lecture. Alternatively, students could come forward with their problems during seminar discussions. Therefore, the claim that in this setting the speaker 'has time to take questions' is not a real benefit."
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"The main idea behind flipped classroom is that the lecturer pre-records the lecture (allegedly by cutting its duration to half of the &lsquo;live&rsquo; lecture), and then students can discuss the material in small groups. It is claimed that this way the students are more involved, and they can (and are willing to) express their ideas.I have no doubt that the flipped classroom technique may have benefits under certain circumstances. However, I am yet to be convinced that it can largely replace the more conventional lectures-seminar discussions axis. My concerns and doubts are the following: (1) I fail to see how the lecture time is halved by pre-recording it. (2) I think one of the benefits of live lectures is interaction. The speaker maintains contact with the class and responds if (s)he feels that a thought did not make sense to the audience. This crucial aspect of the conventional lectures is taken away. (3) My best memories of tertiary education are those of excellent lectures. A good lecture is exciting, engaging, thought-provoking, and enjoyable. These features would be mostly taken away by a YouTube presentation. (4) I do not like the idea that the lecture is converted to a humongous multi-group seminar discussion. To me, it seems largely ineffective, almost chaotic. (5) According to the presenter, one of the benefits of this teaching technique is that the speaker has time to take questions at the end of the lecture. I remain unconvinced that this is a real benefit because most speakers would take questions anyway at the end of the lecture. In addition, students have the chance to come forward with their problems during seminar discussions. This is what seminar discussions are for.I am curious what students think about this technique. Unfortunately, this is not explained in the demonstration video."
00:00:56,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,"Time saving","I do not understand how you can save 50-75% of lecture time by pre-recording."
00:03:29,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,"Number of instructors","I am wondering if one would also increase the number of teaching staff during the F2F sessions, especially when the class size is very large."
----,"Bram Hoex",comment,student,"Flipped class room","In principle I like the concept of flipped class room as it allows the students to complete the lectures at their own pace (and they can view them again) and to make better use of the F2F sessions. A potential downside is, however, that you do not get direct feedback on the lecture from your students (e.g. if you are going too fast and loose your students early in the lecture). But in general I consider it a very good way to increase deep learning."
----,"Marcus De Leeuw",comment,student,null,"Some remarks: 1) this adds a lot of extra time to preparing a lecture: pre-recording it!2)how do I know students have actually seriously engaged with it 3) the inter-active work is good, I do similar things - on a smaller scale - in class but mixed with building knowledge in the lecture4) i post several so-called reading questions on a forum that each students needs to answer and submit two hours before class, I than use some of these questions during my classIIn short: I am not for pre-recorded lectures and no real lecture in class but I am for the interactivities...thus, a mixed model!"
00:01:17,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,"Time Saving","It is unclear to me how the per-recorded lecture saves half the time of the traditional lecture? However, I agree that it can help students go through the lecture in their own pace."
00:02:04,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,"Intercation with students","Isn't it a big task for one person to interact with all the groups formed from hundreds of students? This approach might be more suitable for Prac classes."
----,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",comment,student,"Flipped Classroom","This is an interesting concept. It is clear how the flipped classroom offers a more interactive approach that would benefit deep learning. However, whether this alternative is feasible for busy academics and whether it is suitable for all type of students (e.g. the shy ones) is questionable."
00:00:42,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"This model has advantages for large classes as you would normally not have time to engage with that many students and it allows the students to engage with one another."
00:01:32,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"There will be some extra time in preparation of the video or activities for the teacher before classes but once you have them set-up it could perhaps save time the next time you run the course."
----,"Melinda Chylinski",comment,student,,"This model definitely has some advantages for larger groups. Having the students complete some activities before the class will give them time to think about the content and allow them time to think about any questions they may have about the content.However it will mean that a little extra preparation time is needed to prepare any pre-session activities and some students who are not comfortable with group activities may not be as engaged as those that are."
00:00:48,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"This collaborative learning model sounds very similar to the way tutorials operate"
00:02:45,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"What kind of privacy issues are raised around videoing students?"
00:00:44,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"At UNSW we have many classes that have upwards of 700 students, I can't see this mode of lecture working at this scale"
----,"Jessica Ford",comment,student,,"Based on dwindling lecture attendance, I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that many of our students are primarily accessing the lecture via the Moodle and listening/watching it outside of the classroom before tutorials. Given the significant amount of preparation (lecture, screening &amp; reading) that students need to do for film and media courses I don&rsquo;t think lecture attendance is huge deal. Recording lectures via the Echo360 system means that students who do not want to attend the face-to-face lecture have the option of engaging with the lecture material using the flipped model. Yet students who wan to attend the lecture have the option to do so."
00:00:44,"Sara Mesgari Hagh",annotation,student,,"watch video before coming class and do some group works in the class"

00:00:37,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"recording of lectures","To record lectures is a time consuming task. As a casual lecturer and tutor I have found that presenting a series of lecture slides supported by numerous Youtube videos demonstrating key aspects and information contained in the slides to be just as effective."
00:01:38,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,Quiz,"I used this approach last semester where i began the class with a 15 min quiz based on the lecture slides and Youtube videos I had uploaded onto Moodle. My quiz was not an open note quiz and they completed an answer sheet which counted towards their final grade. (need to find a better way to administer this part)) At the conclusion of the quiz where I would rerun the quiz and invite answers from the students and would lead to a general discussion. i would also have lots of physical samples at hand to show or demonstrate specific details. However you always get the same students answering! Need for improvement here!"
00:01:29,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"Video is a great resource for students who need to work slowly through a complex topic, have a first-language that is not English, or just want to review material in their own time. But this is not restricted to the flipped classroom model. Most lectures at UNSW are automatically recorded with video and audio."
00:02:50,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"recording students privacy and security","I have recored students in the past usually group presentations and whilst I made it known prior to class that this was going to happen i also ensured that videos can only be viewed with a security password link from me. They could not copy or download and they were deleted after a 2 week period."
00:01:56,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"A serious problem with this approach is ensuring that groups are not taken over by the most outgoing or opinionated students. Quite, shy, or less outgoing students may not benefit as much from these activities"
00:03:42,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"Interesting point about developing more high-quality relationships with their instructor. Certainly it would be nice to have more one-to-few interactions, as in the small group projects. But how can a single instructor possibly do this with hundreds of students in a chaotic classroom situation like this? It sounds exhausting!"
----,"Gregory Martens",comment,student,"Flipped Classroom","I like the concept of the flipped classroom. I am able to move around the whole class and encourage engagement from everybody regardless of the activity that is being presented or conducted. It also helps with keeping the students engaged rather than being distracted with FB or playing games on their smartphone or tablet!"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"Applying ""flipped classroom"" ideas to large enrollment courses like this is a major challenge. Some ideas introduced in this video include pre-recorded lectures that students review before class; an open-notes quiz to test their understanding; small group discussion and presentation; and video recordings of students that are available for future reflection and feedback. Some of these are great ideas, but it seems strange to me that they are shoe-horned into a large-enrollment program like the one shown. These kinds of activities would surely be much more effective in smaller rooms, with rearrangable chairs and tables that the lecturer can circulate around (much as we have in FULT). And the effort and preparation required of the lecturer seems super-human. There is a lot we can do to improve student engagement and learning outcomes in large enrollment courses. Perhaps we should start by designing suitable learning spaces, and recognizing the work and effort that goes into preparing these kinds of flipped classroom experiences for students!"
00:01:27,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"Video might be a good tool, but if the video is boring (or students are lazy), students might skip the video and come to the class without watching video. Or students might feel that they don&rsquo;t need to attend the class because they can learn from Video. How can we prevent it?"
00:01:54,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I wonder how I can develop exercises in the flipped class situation for subjects in engineering or physics."
00:02:47,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I think students must be highly-motivated for these activities."
----,"Carolien van Ham",comment,student,,"What I like about flipped classroom is that it allows to cater for individual student differences: smart students that get bored in class can go through the recorded lecture faster &amp; students that need more time to digest lecture material can watch the lecture several times. I also love doing class exercises, even in large groups, I think it keeps students activated, interested and involved; and it allows them to apply their knowledge, probably helping to retain knowledge. I'm less convinced about the benefit of (a) video-taping the lecture before class and (b) video-taping group answers. First of all, I don't think many students will actually watch the lecture on beforehand (not even if there is a quiz at the start of class), and they will certainly not watch the group recordings once the class is over (why would they if it doesn't contribute to passing the class?). Secondly though and more importantly, I think interaction in class during the lecture through questions &amp; answers from students to teacher and vice versa is really important for learning, so I would probably prefer to give the lecture &amp; video-tape it so that both lecture and Q&amp;A are available after class. I would definitely include group exercises during lectures, seeking to make lectures as short and concise as possible; but also there I would prefer live interaction; i.e. presentations of groups to each other in class; instead of video interaction."
----,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",comment,student,,"Flipped classroom is an interesting idea which will be effective for, in particular, a large class (not too large). But I still think that it might be hard to conduct the good flipped classroom because students must be highly-motivated, and activities in the class should be well-organised. I&rsquo;m wondering how to come up with effective activities for my own subjects in engineering or physics. Also, I&rsquo;m wondering how to assess the activities in the flipped classroom. Assessment criteria might also be adjusted to accord with the classroom activities."
00:01:00,"Fanny Salignac",annotation,student,"Length of lectures","Very short lectures - I use an interactive style in class based on discussion and case studies and am all for more discussions and applications of lectures to real life scenarios but I have a hard time imagining needing to cut my lectures down to 15 mins."

00:02:54,"Christopher Oakey",annotation,student,,"It seems like a particularly male co-hort being recorded. There is the risk that less ... outgoing individuals may be disadvantaged in this sort of task. It also perhaps betrays a certain American cultural forthrightness that may not translate to other university or student cultures easily."
----,"Christopher Oakey",comment,student,,"The flipped lecture model seems like it has a lot of advantages. Quite how this translates into flipped classroom activities, though, may need a more careful development depending on culture, institution, and course."
----,"Fanny Salignac",comment,student,"General comment","I like the concept of the flipped classroom very much - it provides higher interactivity in the classroom therefore allowing for active learning and learning from peers. It also provides increased flexibility to cater to different styles of learning especially in terms of the speed at which students learn. But I would really like and would most definitely need some support in terms of coming up with ideas, especially with what is supported by the university, with the use of all this technology such as a video camera, recording etc... and how to work those."

00:02:16,"Robin Turner",annotation,student,,"Another thing that scares me about trying this out in a large class - getting attention back quickly when needed. Though I do think it's a brilliant idea to use lectures in this way!"
----,"Robin Turner",comment,student,,"I really like this approach but I find it difficult to make the leap to the right kind of in-class activities that will engage students and facilitate learning. I think having the lectures recorded is definitely a great way to let students self-pace their learning. The interactive session could be hard to manage in a large classroom."

But, I think it will be difficult to focus on subjects in such big space and discuss the matters in small groups. I can imagine the class will be so noisy and somehow chaotic. I believe paying enough attention to details of how we are going to develop essential skill of students and make sure that they are ready to move on are very important."

I would really like to look at applying this to my medical student tutorials - I take groups of two students twice a week for an introduction to Rehab medicine placement, involving intro to rehab and key concepts and history taking from a rehab patient. I give the same spiel twice a week. I would like to record the spiel and allow more time during their session to focus on applying that knowledge in the real world. Thankyou!

00:03:42,"Ali Akbar Nezhad",annotation,student,,"This is an effective method of teaching and somehow reflects what we do at our core civil engineering courses. Though, I believe the method used currently in our classes is more efficient than the method described in the video. Our core civil engineering courses usually have around 350 to 450 students. We usually have lectures where attendance is optional. The students who prefer face to face contact attend the lecture (about 40-60% attendance)  while the lecture is fully recorded and published online.  All students then watch the lecture so that they can participate in the pre-planned activities during the tutorial sessions. In my course, the suggested activities are done in the tutorial session which is usually a few days after the lecture. This is pretty much the flipped method described in the video with the advantage that students are given the chance to interact with the lecturer during the lecture delivery if they wish so. This is especially a better approach in engineering because we commonly get questions from students which require us to repeat the same concepts in different words or with different approaches. This cannot be replaced by replaying the respective section in the video."

----,"Rosa Scalzo",comment,student,null,"The flipped classroom ideas shared in this video are very appealing. There are many advantages of using flipped classroom teaching strategies. Recording the lecture and asking students to watch it prior to lecture permits them to come to class with a precise idea of the content of the lecture, it promotes critical thinking and self-reflection.  A recorded lecture also facilitates different learning paces and makes save time since the F2F session is done in the video. The lecture so becomes very interactive like a large tutorial. Problem solving activities are performed using cooperative role models: presenter, time keeper, facilitator, etc. I also like the idea of having a quiz based on the content of the lecture. What it does not seem working very well for me is the fact that recording every week a lecture plus preparing a class quiz canbe very time consuming for a casula lecturer as I am. I also have some doubts in the choise to focus on the product more than on the process. Every student should be praised for what they did regardless the ultimate result. As a teacher I am interested more in the process than in the product."
----,"Zahra Stardust",comment,student,,"I love the concept of making students more actively engaged in producing and publishing their ideas (literally) and driving the learning process themselves. This feels a little like what we already do in a big tutorial to me. It also sounds like extra work, preparing and recording the lecture beforehand, especially if you will already have tutorials. I also see problems with getting students to prepare by watching the lecture - although I see this is lessened by shortening it to 15 minutes. I like it in theory, and am interested to try it and see how it goes in practice."

00:02:08,"Danny King",annotation,student,"Selecting people to share, Danny","That is a good point - instead of having every group to report (which I do when I try to roll this type of thing out in my own class) I should pre-assess and select the best ones - they are the ones that can access higher CP by being selected."
00:02:55,"Danny King",annotation,student,"Artefacts, recording, Danny","This is an interesting idea - students who ""win"" by having the most interesting answers being recorded for the benefit of their peers / being stored for later use."
----,"Danny King",comment,student,"Flipping concerns, Danny","There are some great ideas in this video that go some way to addressing my concerns about flipping &ndash; in particular, the quiz / shaming of those who haven&rsquo;t done the course work, and the curating of group outcomes to select a few to show their work off &ndash; which can be recorded for the benefit of their peers as &lsquo;artefacts&rsquo;."
00:00:17,"Aron Michael",annotation,student,"large class room","It is interesting to learn that there is a model for making large class more engaging. I have done a fair bit of large class teaching and one of the challenges I have faced and I think other might face is to make large class more engaging and appealing to everyone."
00:00:59,"Aron Michael",annotation,student,"cut lecture time","The reduction of lecture time by more than 50% is interesting. But I wonder if this is always possible because especially with big classes there is a tendency of diversity."
00:01:22,"Aron Michael",annotation,student,"Get the attention","Recording lecture is useful when it comes to getting the attention of the students as they have the liberty to play the video as many times as they need. Therefore, the concern of having some students get lost and others bored can be taken care of."
00:02:20,"Aron Michael",annotation,student,"Is there enough time?","Although the speaker claims that students formed smaller groups, made discussions among themselves, he was able to go around and interact with the students and even recorded some of students answer, had time to entertain questions from the students at the end, will this be always possible depending on the class size and in terms of covering discussion topics?"
----,"Aron Michael",comment,student,,"The concept of flipped class room is interesting as it will create a more engaging and interactive learning environment. However, I am wondering why it is applied to large class room and how it is different from normal tutorial classes where students are encouraged to form groups and discuss tutorial questions which are drawn from the lecture material covered prior to the tutorial except in this flipped class room some student can get the opportunity of being recorded and reflect on that one. I would think flipped class room is more effective in smaller class size. There are other issues with the concept as well: (i) it is only effective if students come to class after watching the video. In my experience 50% of students often do not do that. (ii) especially with large classes, number of discussion topics may be compromised."
00:00:45,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"think critically &amp; creatively","I think the transition to using the F2F time with students to help them think more critically and creatively is a huge benefit to understanding and applying knowledge"
00:01:12,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"ability for students to move at own pace","The ability for students to move at their own pace really resonated with me. I often worry in lectures that for 15% of students you are moving way too slow and for another 15% you are way too fast - finding that ""happy"" medium is the great unknown. using video addresses this."
00:02:33,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"videoing specific responses","I'm not convinced that this would work in the Australian setting. I think I would prefer sharing from 3-4 groups and then in the post activity getting individuals to reflect on what this means."
----,"Kaye Chan",comment,student,,"It was interesting to see the application of the flipped philosophy in a traditional lecture setting. I think shifting focus to collaboratively working in ""teams"" to think critically and creatively is a huge advantage to the traditional linear delivery of information."
00:01:20,"Jeremy Henson",annotation,student,null,"great idea - always thinkable something lecturer said and miss an important point"
00:03:28,"Jeremy Henson",annotation,student,null,"means they can also google obvious questionsor rethink dumb questions to improve efficciency"
00:03:37,"Jeremy Henson",annotation,student,null,"full set of blloms taxonomy from remebering to creative crosslinking in one lesson, great"
----,"Jeremy Henson",comment,student,null,"seems great in lots of ways - better control for students of initial learning, better understanding and crosslinking. Just need to make sure students have done pre-work first"
