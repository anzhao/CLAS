00:00:48,"Shanaka Herath",annotation,student,,"There are two efficiencies that fliiped classrooms bring : the lecturer is cut down and students who want to go through the lecture again can do so.I certainly agree with the latter efficiency. However, in regards to the first efficiency, though the lecture time is cut down, it's at the cost of more time required for the lecturer to prepare the video."
00:00:00,"Mariam Farida",annotation,student,"flipped classroom","i found the flipped classroom interesting but i have not used this in my teaching yet. i have few comments in terms of:1-is reducing the time of the lecture from 50 minutes to 12-24 minutes good if i am teaching condensed material such as international law or international relations?2-will the flipped class technique work with teaching languages? i am interested to find out more 3-i found that what is suggested is very convenient with large classes, and i still teach small groups so it definitely gave me something to think about when i start teaching bigger classes4-finally, watching the video of the lecture is also convenient because students can fast forward or repeat something that wasn't 100% clear.i would want to learn more about flipped classes because i have not felt the need to use them yet, as my tutorials are small in size."

00:02:09,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,"Omar Hussain","good point. But if the class is of 100 students - I as a lecturer may not be able to go to all the groups. This I can do easily in the small group tutorials that I do."
00:02:26,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,"Omar Hussain","a problem can be dominating students who get the limelight at all times."
00:02:37,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,"Omar Hussain","this is good as in the small tutorials only the small group of attendees are available for discussion."
----,"Omar Hussain",comment,student,"Omar Hussain","Overall a good approach but:1. A prerequisite is for the students to do the learning first before this can be effective. 2. Another issue is if this is a big class, I would not be able to go to each group and pay attention to each student which I can do in a small tutorial group."
00:01:32,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,"pre-classroom activity","Students are expected to have already watched the video before coming to the class.My experience with providing recommended readings is that few students do the readings before coming to class. Are they more likely to watch a video? What happens to students who haven't watched the video beforehand?"

00:02:31,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,"Student presentations","How do you make sure that all students actively participate from week to week and that it's not just the more confident students presenting?Also, I know that as a student I would have been mortified at the thought of presenting in front of a video camera. I found it hard enough to put my hand up in tutorials to answer questions, even if I'd done all the readings beforehand."
----,"Sonia Graham",comment,student,,"I can see that there are considerable benefits to a flipped classroom in terms of getting students to actively 'do' rather than passively 'listen' in large classroom settings. I can also see how this is likely to encourage deeper learning, especially among those students who are proactive about watching the videos beforehand. But I can also see how it might motivate students who might otherwise take a shallow approach to take a deeper approach.I'm unclear on whether it is expected that all lecture in a course are taught using this approach or just a few. It seems that a mixture of approaches might work best."

00:01:27,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"This is definitely one of the positive sides of online lectures."
00:03:21,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I think that this is a great model and I can see it working quite well in one of my courses.I do believe, though, that this type of ""interactive lecture"" can only work with a group of 100max students."
----,"Valentina Bau",comment,student,,"This is a very interesting approach and I'd be very open to experiment it in one of my courses. My question is: would this type of lecture replace the tutorials, which are part of the Australian university education system? (not sure about the US) Or are we looking at having an online lecture, a face-to-face flipped lecture, plus tutorials?? I am interested to understand where this is placed in our structure, or whether it suggests a new structure all together.I also would like to know more about strategies to implement this model with very large classes."
00:00:45,"Stephen Doherty",annotation,student,,"This scene demonstrates an issue I've come across in flupping lectures. The space for my lectures is difficult to use for group work for students as they are not able to move the seating. Traditional lecture theatres allow for discussion between, I think, 2-3 students who sit next to each other. Communicating with students in rows in front and behind can be difficult."
00:01:34,"Stephen Doherty",annotation,student,,"We *hope* that students have already watched the video prior to class. He is making a great assumption here."

00:02:59,"Stephen Doherty",annotation,student,,"At UNSW, do we need to obtain students' written permission to make recordings of them, as per this example?"
----,"Stephen Doherty",comment,student,,"I find this idea very exciting. I've tried it out a little in my lectures, but I find the limitations in the physical space to be a difficult hurdle to overcome. If the lecture is quite large, it may be difficult to get to all group and it would be a risk to have a small number of large groups. I'd also worry that students don't watch the videos before class, or watch them while doing something else. I know we could argue that they would do the same in the lecture, but I think it is more likely they will be paying attention in the lecture, than if they are watching it in their own time."
00:01:27,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"Flipped Classrooms","I do think that allowing students to move at their own pace through a flipped classroom style learning experience is a definite bonus. I do find that some students struggle to catch all the information in a lecture and this allows them to go and review material. On the other hand, I also find that some students require more examples which are asked in a typical lecture and you couldn't possibly predict to add into a pre-recorded lecture."
00:01:39,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"Quiz at the start of lecture","I like this idea to nip any problem areas in the bud prior to moving onto other content. I also this is a good tool for reflection for the lecturer to assess whether or not the pre-recorded lecture is getting the salient information across"
----,"Samantha Furfari",comment,student,"General Comments","I like the idea of flipped classrooms but smaller classes (&lt;100). I'm not sure how practical it would be for big course in first year (I'm thinking of CHEM1011 which has well over 500 students in it). I suppose I have always thought of lectures as the delivery of content and tutorials for indepth discussion and working through problems. The flipped classroom approach switches this up with lectures becoming more like 'old school' tutorials...would this mean that tutorials in the future become obsolete? I do see strengths and weakness in the flipped classroom approach, I think my personal preference would be for a blended learning approach. I really like the interaction with students during lectures as we go through content."
00:00:39,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,videos,"The videos would have to be structured effectively to keep students from losing concentration. I tend to jump around on the internet during long videos because of a short attention span and I can see this being the case with a lot of people."

00:02:42,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"That's a lot of movement for a large class, I feel like more time is lost this way."
----,"Anna Yeung",comment,student,,"I'm not completely convinced about the benefits of a flipped classroom. Some elements, such as being able to re-watch concepts you might have missed in the first lecture are good but I feel it loses more time than it gains. The interactive portion of the lecture is essentially the same as a tutorial."
----,"Juan Alvarez Gaitan",comment,student,#FULTMODULE2,"After watching this video and reading some material: tip 1: Don't use the word ""flipped"" with your students tip 2: Use innovative ways to  assess your learning outcomes"
00:00:43,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,"Flipping the class","Actually, a very interesting way of getting students more involved in their own learning."
00:01:40,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,"Students are to revise contents before coming to the class","I think this is a very interesting concept. Before attending to the class, students have already had to think about what is going to be talked about. In this way, curiosity can act as a principal motivation for getting engaged in your own learning."
00:02:27,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,"Not sure whether this may work for big groups","The fact that during a 5-10 minutes critical discussion, the professor needs to go on talking to each group and see what are they concluding, probably makes difficult an accurate evaluation (for the professor). I am not sure whether this part of the flipping class would work for big groups..."
----,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",comment,student,"Claudio Cazorla","From this video, I have got three different interesting concepts:-Flipping the class for getting the student engaged on its own learning experience-Students are to revise contents before coming to the class-Intensive work in groups and discussionsIn general, I find the ""flipping the class"" concept very interesting and I do really think that by taking the student out of the routine they can get further motivate. Also, the dynamic that the students must revise the contents before attending to the class I find that is great. However, I am a bit skeptical on that the ""intensive discussion"" approach will really serve for teaching to all class of groups and in all knowledge areas. First, because this demands a huge amount of work from the professor, I doubt it may be accurate in big groups. And second, I find that the ""discussion"" approach always assumes that the contents which are going to be reviewed are somehow already integrated in the student consciousness. However, in some cases, I completely disagree with such a principle. Think, for instance, of a first time ""Quantum Physics"" class. Quantum physics does not really work in the macroscopic work in which we life, hence what is a previous knowledge students may have on quantum physics? generally, this is going to be null. Is there any sense in making a discussion about something students totally ignore? I take the ""flipping class"" concept with me, but understanding that the way in which you really make this may be very different depending on the number of students you have and the topic you are teaching."

----,"Li Fu",comment,student,"flipped classroom","I think flipped classroom is a good and interesting way for learning and teaching, especially fostering students participation. But I think this way is similar as tutorial. If all lectures can be delivered like this, perhaps there won't be tutorial? And this way might be difficult for large class, like over 200 students."
----,"Yue Huang",comment,student,"wonderful idea","I think the innovation of flipped classroom interesting. It is flexible learning process and encourages students participation. It is a fun learning. In medicine teaching, we have Scenario group discussion, similar to the second part of discussion. The first part of video lecturing is still in person."
00:00:00,"Yue Huang",annotation,student,"how to design collaborative projects","Apart from lecturing, there are collaborative projects to add on. In the class, there would be around 100 students, and about 10 groups. It is said through group exercise, role, time keeper, group presenter are appointed. If each group have 7 minutes to present, there would be about 90-120 mins for one lecture. Not sure whether it is doable in terms of time allowance in our university."
----,"Hossein Masoumi",comment,student,,"It is a good model, however the main remaining issue is that how to encourage students allocate some times to watch the clip before coming to lecture. In many instances I realised that students prefer to watch the lecture after the class if they missed anything."

I wonder if a class is designated as a three hour lecture and I am paid 3 x lecture rate if the university expects a 3 hour lecture, if a flipped approach needs to be approved, and if the pay scale changes."
----,"Nicole Lasky",comment,student,,"I am very interested in the flipped approach and I know that UNSW is generally supportive.  I have three questions - 1. Will the university provide equipment and materials. e.g. in the video the lecturer used white boards for each group and he used a tripod.  He probably used his own smart phone.  2.  If a casual is paid 3 x lecture rate, does a flipped approach need to be approved and does it affect pay? 3.  The instructor in this video said that his lectures went from 50 minutes to 12 - 24 minutes.  Where is the content difference made up?  textbook reading?  in class?"

There are some key assumptions that need to be met in order for the face-to-face to work - students have watched the video/read required material, and group activities work as planned. I'm guessing this replaces traditional lecture/prac/tutorial scenario? I can see its advantage in stimulating critical thought and getting the students engaged, while simultaneously getting them to work collegially and developing their communication skills. Perhaps this approach can stimulate deep learning? I'd be interested in trying it out for some of my lectures."

However, the reality is that not all students are prepared when they come to the class. If some of them, or majority of them are not prepared, the activities we facilitate in a class do not function. Thus, we need to think about the balance between the preparation outside the class and in the class although I totally agree with the idea that classes are place where students put knowledge into a practice."

I agree with many of the other comments that it is often the case that the majority of students come unprepared to class. While in a prefect world we could change this, I think that we do need to be realistic about the amount of work prior to class we expect students to perform. I think if it consists of watching the clip and making notes this is possible. In my experience with some flipped courses there tends to be an extremely large amount of outside work and the students are not motivated nor do they have the time to complete the material. If there are ways that we encourage them to complete and prepare for class while still having realistic expectations of them I think this would be a great model"

The pre-recorded lecture component would be very helpful to many students as they can spend as much or as little time as they need to take in the material.

----,"Corey Martin",comment,student,"General Comment","The ""flipped classroom"" methodology seems to have merit in some courses and maybe not so much in others.There is an assumption that students have access to available infrastructure like ""internet"" to watch the videos and that they have done the pre-work.I note that the presenter says that this type of method is targeted at engaging larger classes, however the basic items like the actual lecture theatre (layout &amp; seating) is unlikely to be suited to the type of activities that he is proposing (e.g. group work) as my experience is that students find it very difficult to engage with others in teams greater than 2 students just to the physical constraints.There is also now pressure on the lecturer to both provide a professional looking video to students (as the one shown in this video was poor) as well as not to become lazy in recording the video once with outdated information, so additional time (as a lot of effort can be spent in what is known as post-production) to do this task needs to be considered as well as the skills needed to deliver this correctly.My last comment is around the emphasis that is put on the students learning from each other and the risk that they may tend to drift off topic as well as use their limited knowledge in an area to make conclusions and potentially treat their experiences as being the expert knowledge rather than researching others work in the area."
00:03:42,"Rose Butler",annotation,student,,"It also requires students take more responsibility for their learning, which is a plus, but for some this would take some time to learn and improve - depending on their high school educational experiences/histories. I do like though how it caters to people's different learning paces/strengths/weaknesses in terms of how quickly they take up concepts based on previous knowledge. It also means they could come to class with questions formulated rather than emailing after the lecture. We are teaching in 3 hour blocks with no tutorials, which is a great model and would adapt will with this."

----,"Arash Khatamianfar",comment,student,"Potentials of flipped classroom","I feel that there are great potentials in flipped classrooms, but I believe it should be tailored based on the discipline and the course so that it can be more productive and encouraging for students to engage in class activities. One example is that the basic background can be reviewed in the pre-recorded video and then in the class students could better follow new materials rather than losing focus due to lack of background knowledge, and also tutorial classes can also be combined in some form of flipped classroom."

However, one question I have is whether students would still come to lectures, something that I think is essential to feel part of a community and mental health and therefore also study success. So one would have to make sure that what is done in the lectures is crucial or valuable for students."

----,"Ateeq Rauf",comment,student,Flipped?,"In my view, the idea of the flipped classroom has pros and cons. Pros1. Students are more engaged in class as opposed to the lecture model2. Students can gain additional practical exposure to concepts (deep learning)3. Lecture time is reduced and students can learn concepts at their own pace through the video4. Students have more reason to come to class as they see more value than just regurgitation of the textbookCons1. If students do not prepare beforehand, then the classroom experience will be poor2. Much more effort required by the instructor in recording, uploading, updating videos.3. Camera shy students would be hesitant to participate and students who are free-riding would be still hidden in group work4. Concepts that were poorly explained in the video cannot be questioned by the students. 5. A round table format for such a class would be better. May require traditional infrastructure overhaul.6. The question is how effective is students learning from each other than from the instructor. Perhaps there should be more input from the instructor.General Comment I believe the flipped classroom approach can be used as a supplement to the traditional classroom approach for some part of the course. While traditionally classes have been lecturer-centric, I believe the flipped classroom overbalances the lecturer-led/student-led ratio. More time could be spent in explaining difficult concepts in class and also bringing students to some fundamental level in case students are ill-prepared for a class.  So I would advise part lecture, part activity for a typical class. Also, could we not have students prepare from reading material rather than watch a video...this would take off a lot of work pressure from the lecturer. The activity proposed in the video is an example in my opinion; not every flipped class has to have an activity in which posters are held out and recordings done...by the way, I think classroom time would also be better utilized otherwise than to have the whole class wait to record some"

00:03:42,"Natalie Ross",annotation,student,,"I think developing a high quality relationship with the teacher in a large lecture setting would be valuable for the students - presumably they would feel more comfortable asking questions and giving feedback."
----,"Natalie Ross",comment,student,,"I think the flipped classroom could be very successful in engaging the students and getting them to grapple with the content in greater depth than they would by attending a standard lecture, but it relies heavily on the students watching the video lecture before coming to class. Would this happen reliably??"
00:00:46,"Catherine Ryan",annotation,student,,"Flipped classroom model in a large lecture style classes appears challenging. Physically the space does not lend itself easily to group discussion. However, if students completed some formative task prior to the lecture, this may assist in their understanding of content. The lecturer also receives feedback on the cohorts understanding."

00:02:14,"Catherine Ryan",annotation,student,,"Using the small whiteboards is a great idea. Engaging students to be part of the lecture (recording) is also good. Unprepared students will quickly learn to get on board, especially if the lecturer can provide evidence (test results) that flipped learning is worth it. Ask yourself..What's in it for them?"
00:02:54,"Catherine Ryan",annotation,student,,"Photographing or videoing student responses is excellent. Only a very confident lecturer would engage in this way. Consider: additional items (camera), extra time for uploading images/videos, lecture management. From a student learning perspective ....excellent. Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn (Benjamin Franklin)."
----,"Catherine Ryan",comment,student,,"Students need to be 'sold' the difference between the flipped and 'chalk &amp; talk' models. What's the benefit for them? Doing extra work each week before the lecture, when they would normally cram before the exam / assessment is due, to 'gain' knowledge, may be enticing for all. Lecturers may say 'is better for you' to learn this way, but I think students should know why!"
