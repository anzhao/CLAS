----,"Anne Lonie",comment,student,,"Judging by the video and some other articles I have looked at, the main problem seems to be ""excessive flexibility"" in the face of significant aerodynamic forces.  Glad I wasn&rsquo;t on it at the time!"
----,"Sue Lefebvre",comment,student,"More information about the event","For more detail to assist you in answering the question regarding why the construction continued even though the swaying/uplift occurred during construction, the following link will help:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940)"
00:00:21,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"Forces to create this swaying are spectacular"
00:01:28,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"To think that this was filmed in 1940 is awesome but I guess they knew it was coming since it was a windy day and had swayed previously."
----,"Sue Lefebvre",comment,student,,"Can anybody find out why the construction wasn't stopped, assessed and the bridge redesigned even though what was constructed was a very bad (in retrospect) alteration to the original design?"
00:02:22,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"Those lightpoles were attached well."
00:02:00,"Sue Lefebvre",annotation,student,,"Very brave man."
----,"Sue Lefebvre",comment,student,,"I found the music accompaniment a bit weird. Though a sad event for Tubby the dog the oscillating and flexing was beautiful to see."
----,"Philip Dunbar",comment,student,"Phil Dunbar","Very Interesting to watch, The amount of osculation in the bridge when it really starts to move is amazing to watch, In relation to why they continued to build the bridge, this bridge was built on a reduced budget, potentially to make it viable on a proposed design. As the bridge was being built there were attempts makes to stop the movement in the bridge that had been noted by the worker on the bridge while construction was progressing. However none of there were successful. Thanks for the interesting link on this bridge Sue, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Narrows_Bridge_(1940), Information was reviewed on the 20/10/2014."
00:01:16,"Constantine Benza",annotation,student,"Catastrophic - Con","Construction continued despite the swaying having been noticed earlier. This may indicate that insufficient modelling and testing had been carried out. The project quality was inferior, possibly owing to either calculation errors, or some constraints that were not taken on board appropriately, such as time and / or budgetary limitations. It is unclear whether the overriding factor was an engineering decision alone, or other pressures: political and / or business considerations. But the result was clearly catastrophic.The bridge's oscillations were so huge they appeared like giant sea waves as the structure wet into its natural frequency of oscillation and into resonant frequency, thus collapsing.The fact that this was captured on video is priceless despite the disaster: it will be used for training and for deriving engineering lessons. It will be useful for modelling and for driving home important engineering project messages - a picture telling a thousand words as the adage goes!"
----,"Constantine Benza",comment,student,"Lessons Learnt","Disastrous but important for engineering project training and reducing future failures! It could have been worse were it a busy time on and off the bridge!"
00:03:18,"Lee Thiele",annotation,student,,"I believe the engineers chose to continue building the bridge after noticing it swaying because larger bridges built on the same principles were already in existence and had no issues. Leading up to WWII, I believe that cost would have played the largest role in this failure."
----,"Lee Thiele",comment,student,,"Failure to consider all the conditions the bridge would be exposed too allowed engineers to propose such a flimsy and cost effective design. Interesting to note that the fault was noticed and remedied in three months of scale testing after the bridge was completed. Perhaps incorporating this scale testing in the design phase would have prevented this failure."
00:01:07,"Gavin Warner",annotation,student,,"I believe the engineers continued to build the bridge even after noticing the swaying before completion due to the success of previous similar designs, and the possibility they were under immense pressure from either the local government or construction company to complete the work. Due to it occurring in the 1940's, the aftermath of WWI could also have played a role.No person would have continued the development if they suspected this may have happened."
