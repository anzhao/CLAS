00:02:18,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"That's a tricky point to grasp, as a new lecturer, but I think he is saying that the point of evaluations is not testing students to judge them on how much they have been able to learn, but to constantly be appraising and reflecting on the success or otherwise of the approach to teaching that is in play, and to be constantly revising and rethinking those approaches in response. It is the teacher who is the primary subject of evaluation, because a good teacher will be able to get strong and positive outcomes for their students. I think...?"
00:05:58,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Again, as a new lecturer, this is something I've been trying to work out this year - how far am I expected to push my students in engaging with difficult concepts and practices, and how much should I simply be impressed that they tried really hard (and their effort is obvious), but it is not an area they are likely to be able to get great at? Perhaps this is because I teach a compulsory course which is not in line with the core interests of quite a few of the students who are required to complete it, but I am pleased to hear such a strong statement in support of teachers having a duty to expect students to challenge themselves as the most effective approach to learning."
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"I found myself getting a little confused in this video about whether the evaluation he was referring to was of the students performance or of the teacher's performance. But perhaps that's the point - evaluating teacher success IS about evaluating student success, and understanding through those processes of feedback, reflection and improvement how to strengthen the approach that is being taken to teaching . I very much like the idea of teachers as change agents, but as a 'social constructionist', I wasn't too sure what to make of his overt dislike of the constructionist turn in educational discourse!"
00:02:34,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,mindset,"I think the mindset he is describing is a positive one but I also think the majority of teachers would have this - so I worry that emphasising it too much would just put extra pressure on those teachers to feel responsible for student outcomes that don't meet expectations.  Would be interesting to see data on what percentage of teachers already see things this way..."
00:06:18,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,consistency?,"Some of this advice sounds much more applicable for small-group or school-level teaching, rather than large-class university courses. Also, while adjusting the curriculum/lesson plan year-to-year depending on the students does sound effective, is there also a need for some consistency in terms of a course offering?"
00:06:55,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,trust,"This point about building trust seems really important.  It would be great to hear some specific tips on how to do this - especially in a large class where there's no chance to build an individual relationship between each student and the lecturer..."
----,"Laura Crommelin",comment,student,,"I think the sort of mindset and standards Prof. Hattie is describing are quite demanding which for the most part is a good thing - as long as teachers have the time, support etc. that they need to be able to implement these kinds of approaches. Also, some of these approaches seem much more suited to a small-class dynamic than a large lecture or a short intensive where you only get very limited interaction with each student. I really liked the point about building trust as a way to encourage interaction in class - it would be great to hear more about different ways of doing this in different class settings..."
00:03:16,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"This idea of mindset seems to contradict a bit the idea in the first video that what we teach is far more important than how we teach"
00:06:33,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"I like the notion of trust, of building a safe space for people to feel they can fail so they can learn."
----,"Mark Braidwood",comment,student,,"In the cognitive psychologist Daniel Kahneman's 'Thinking Fast &amp; Slow' he talks about the limitations of expertise. The two criteria that need to be met to achieve expertise are predictable rules (eg chess but not world politics) and regular feedback. This aligns nicely with what he is suggesting."
00:02:15,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I think that John Hattie is making the point that poor student performance isn't always about the student. The teacher and the student are in the same room, therefore they are part of the same system, and as much as teachers feel that appraising student knowledge is their job, it is also their job to evaluate how well they are performing at their task of providing students the necessary skills to take the next steps on their own."
00:02:30,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of ""the test you give to your students is for you to find out who did you teach well and what did you teach well"". It provides another dimension to assessment."
00:02:47,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"The ""don't blame the kids"" idea is fairly obvious, as soon as you start realizing that some students respond better to you than others, and that those are not necessarily the ""smarter"" students. Rather, it is simply telling of your style as a teacher, and how you come across in the classroom, too. In a participative, small-class environment, it is actually not difficult to identify the students you can connect to more easily, I find that student participation is very telling of that.The challenge is finding a way to keep those students you connect with naturally excited while you are trying to find ways to get others on board. I do think it is my obligation to try to get everyone involved, but I also think it is primarily an obligation of means, and not results. And it troubles me that he is pushing the schtick that it is an obligation of result. He might be being deliberately provocative, but it's worrying nevertheless."
00:04:08,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Why does he snicker at the use of ""jargon"", but still uses it and does nothing to problematize the use of business-speak in this context? Is he catering for teachers or school administrators?"
00:04:59,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Oh, now I see. The point then being that jargon doesn't matter, and that no teacher is one category over the other?"
00:05:52,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"As a big fan of ""sink or swim"", I find myself being reassured here."
----,"Lucas Lixinski",comment,student,,"It's all good on paper, but then some of it sounds a bit whiny, to be honest. Constantly asking for feedback is very often constructed by the students as insecurity, from my experience. And it is also students do not like to do an awful lot of, from where I stand. So, it is a bit problematic to get all this data assembled in a way that is not in itself influencing (and possibly hindering) the learning environment."
00:01:04,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,,"The most productive feedback comes from establishing rapport with students and being open minded about the resultant feedback...being systematic might just produce data for the sake of it and be meaningless."
00:03:05,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,,"Surely change agents are both kids and teachers...nothing happens unless everyone takes ownership."
00:06:18,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,,"Attitudes can change with knowledge and desire....if we wish to change the way we teach we need support and reinforcement of the right ways to do things."
00:08:26,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,,"I'm chortling at the idea that it's not only students who are subject to evidence based teaching but teachers themselves."
00:08:54,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,,"The collegiate initiative of teachers evaluating other teachers is so powerful."
----,"Tom Kramer",comment,student,,"The Prof seems a little angry to me. He talks about mindsets but then turns on the constructivist school of thought. Nevertheless, he was coming from a well researched place. I just don;t know how his ideas would work ion the real world - a world where teachers are time and support poor. He needs to articulate practical strategies a little better."
00:04:44,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I think it would be beneficial for his argument to show data to highlight the contrast between the two styles of teaching. From a personal perspective I've tried and seen both methods, and the active teacher does have better student engagement, but I would like to know if the difference in success (however you choose the measure it) is actually significant. Too often I think people move from one to another because it becomes trendy, but not necessarily better."
00:05:34,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I feel that sometimes teachers avoid giving feedback because they believe that giving too much feedback will give away the answer. It would be good to address how to give contextual feedback without revealing too much about the assessment."
00:07:01,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I like this example - honest feedback requires its own network of trust. It is not a singular relationship"
00:08:47,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"Again, I'd really like to see some hard data to support his ideas"
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,,"I like the general idea of the features that teachers today need to have in order to be effective at what they do. However, in this video I found that it lacked a direction of how to achieve those goals. More importantly, I would have liked to have seen some evidence that supports his observations. No doubt he has done a lot of work in the area, but without the data it's hard to convoke someone to change their teaching in the absence of understanding the true effect of the change."
00:00:29,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"I like the notion that students should see themselves as their own teachers. In my experience, one of the most underutilised resource by students is fellow students. Together, as peers, they can teach each other a lot. However, sometimes the competitive nature of universities (i.e., grade focus) can be a barrier to such peer collaboration (i.e., grades are seen to be a zero sum game)."
00:02:31,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"I think a bit of a problem with this, is that, as lectures, we are situated in the broader political economy of the university. So there are pressures and structures in terms of what assessments should be done, and what distributions your broader student grades should fall within. There are also issues such as rapid expanding tutorial classes (up to 30 now); which weakens the ability of a tutor to build rapport with individual students."
00:04:13,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"This builds upon my previous point - he mentions ""smaller class sizes."" Unfortunately those decisions are made by higher authorities at the university (with economics, not education outcomes, being the bottom line)"
00:06:27,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"I agree completely. Building trust is definitely important. You need to create an environment that facilities students being comfortable to ask questions about areas that they are unsure of."
00:07:01,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"I think a bit of self-critique can help in this regard. AS a lecturer, not to present yourself as an unquestionable expert on the topic area. But as a fellow traveller, who has some previous experience on the journey. That way the subject is a co-learning experience."
00:08:33,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"I don't like these made up statistics (i.e, 70%). You can't neatly quantify these things. A made up statistic was in the last interview - some more rigour is needed!"
----,"Paul Munro",comment,student,,"From this video, I think the thing that resonated with me the most is about the need to build trust with the students. To create learning environments where students are not afraid to demonstrate gaps in their knowledge (and mine!), so that discussion can be facilitated to address these gaps."
00:07:47,"Robert Walsh",annotation,student,trust,"Significant that Hattie stresses the need to create trust between the students themselves, not just between teacher and student. I can see how this trust is critical in reducing fear of being ""jumped on"" as he put it."
----,"Robert Walsh",comment,student,,"For me, the salient point to take away from this video is that as teachers, we are not just putting out information, we are actively trying to take it in as well. We are part of a feedback loop. The basis of an effective feedback loop is trust, and that trust must be established between all parties. Further, to be of value, this feedback must be based on real evidence."
00:02:11,"Robert Walsh",annotation,student,,"I like the notion of turning assessment and evaluation on it's head. It's not so much about how the student is going. Rather it is about how the effective teacher has been. It's about which strategies have worked and which haven't, establishing why and feeding that back into the loop to create strategic improvement."
00:03:19,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"I resonate with the point made about 'mindset' and that Teachers are 'change agents'. Its important for Teachers to be open to new ways and to view their role as engaging students to bring about changes in thinking and understanding."
00:07:32,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,"Build Trust","Building trust in the classroom, I believe, is crucial to Teacher success. John Hattie has not drawn this out further by showing how to do this other than suggesting building relationships,allowing open discussion and tolerating wrong answers."
00:00:21,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,"Listening Skills Powerful","I agree that active listening is crucial for both teachers and students.  Facilitation moves away from talking at students and enabling the ability to hear how students are learning."
----,"Julie Wilson",comment,student,,"While John Hattie's opinion is at times quite forthright and unbalanced.  The video has reminded me how crucial student-teacher relationships are and underpinning this is the building of trust in the classroom.  I am unsure about constant feedback, often a Teacher can gauge a classes success without asking for it directly. The talk could be more credible if he had included research to backup his thoughts."
00:01:00,"Angela Nickerson",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of students becoming their own teachers. It reinforces how important it is to equip students with the tools to engage in self-directed learning rather than just feeding them the information."
00:05:10,"Angela Nickerson",annotation,student,,"The video lost me at this point. I really wasn't sure what the point was that was being made in relation to fads in teaching. Greater clarity in explanation would have been very helpful."
00:07:11,"Angela Nickerson",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of building trust in the classroom, and making it a safe space for students to give real feedback"
----,"Angela Nickerson",comment,student,,"I think the major point I found to be important in this video is the idea of teaching being an interactive process, with feedback and evaluation helping both sides (the student and the teacher) to improve. However, I found the argument difficult to follow in places, and I felt that the presenter was starting with the assumption that laziness prevents some teachers from engaging this type of approach. I would have been interested in seeing some practical strategies that could be implemented to achieve this."
00:00:20,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,"getting into someone's mind","Thats quite a task but I share his concerns about picking the one who knows the answer rather than getting the answer through them"
00:02:20,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"""Tests are about the kids!"" I am not sure if there are many left among us who can happily continue thinking this way. I always feel pretty bad when I have to give a fail mark because one part of me knows that I sort of failed that student in many ways"
00:04:49,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"how do you measure attitude?"
00:07:47,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"i like the idea of a classroom where an error is tolerated is where the learning occurs"
00:10:08,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"I agree with him , when learning is visible to me as a teacher, than act of teaching is more of a challenge and joy than a task"
----,"Apo Demirkol",comment,student,,"I did find Prof Hattie's talk quite interesting. There has not been a time that I left the classroom wondering how well it well, what percentage of what I aimed to discuss was received etc. However I do not know how to gauge feedback when I teach 12 hours a year in a very large classroom.This will be my challange!"

----,"Meng Tok",comment,student,,"Most of Prof Hattie ideas resonate with me. I believe teachers should be passionate about teaching. They should challenge students but be mindful of their limits and that is where feedback comes in. They should also build trust with their students so that the students can then speak freely and seek the knowledge. However I do believe there is a role of teacher being a facilitator at times, giving the student the space and time to explore and make mistakes and learn in the process. As I teach a 2 hour workshop to a small group of students (different each time) once a month, I find it hard to build rapport and trust during that time. But I certainly try to imbue them with my passion about the subject I teach hoping it will stimulate their interest to ask me questions."

----,"Dianne Anagnos",comment,student,,"Hattie said: ""You've got to build trust before students will tell you they don't know something."" I know he was speaking about high school students, but I really think that this point applies even more to tertiary students, or at least my students.  My courses are practice-based, and students are put in situations that are so very different to their class-based courses.  Many of them freak out a little bit due to the unpredictability of it.  Yet they can still be reluctant to ask for assistance or admit to feeling lost.  I really agree with his following point that learning happens when mistakes are allowed to happen and are tolerated.  Overall, I liked this talk.  I agree with some other comments that it would have been better if he'd used some research to back up his assertions on the importance/methods of evaluation.  However I still took away a lot from this."

----,"Patricia Arthur",comment,student,,"Took me a couple of views..... Is he then saying that you need evidence to do appropriate evaluation and reflection: if under normal circumstances you only get 30%, then reflection is rubbish?? Is the evidence that your students SEEK feedback and appear to be teaching themselves. That's a big call in a university situation in large lecture halls with numerous tutorials. I'll get back to you on that!"
----,"Jelena Rnjak-Kovacina",comment,student,,"A number of ideas in this video resonated with me, including the importance of passion, two-way feedback, building rapport with students and  in particular the idea that mistakes can facilitate learning. However, like some of my colleagues already commented, it would good to have some practical, implementable strategies for achieving this in a setting that is quite different to primary or high school. We often have limited contact with our students (a few lectures in a course) or  teach very large class sizes. I would be interested in  ways of getting constructive feedback from students- what worries me (especially when it comes to promotion-driven evaluations) is the potential for students to give more positive feedback on 'easier' courses, ones where they do better with less work. Then again, this may then be a good point for self evaluation.How do we make difficult/involved content accessible to students?"
00:00:46,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"Students becoming their own teacher is a nice 'catchphrase', and ties in with the 'lifelong learning' idea. [Interesting consequences for evaluation - asking students to what extent they became their own teacher]"
00:04:12,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"It would be helpful if he could provide more details on this ""world of difference"" he mentions. It's not clear to me (at this stage) that the lists are, if you like, mutually exclusive."
00:07:40,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"It's an obvious one, but worth remembering. Tolerate and welcome errors, as that's where the learning occurs."
00:02:04,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"That's a very interesting point about how to approach the subject of evaluation - (i.e., looking at effect sizes and focusing in on aggregate patterns)because I know most instructors become very apprehensive about sharing teaching evaluation with peers and I think this is detrimental to improving teaching."
00:03:12,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"This is absolutely a great point and I think it is one that is lost in the majority of discussions around effective teaching."
00:06:19,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"Great points, but in reality if teaching allocation is determined, at least to some extent, and in some cases quite often, by administrative and logistic concerns instructors may often find themselves in situations where they are teaching material they may not be passionate about - it's not exactly the case that instructors always get to choose what they teach"
00:08:45,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"It's unfortunate that I know of so so many instructors that are simply terrified to stand in front of a group of people. Of course this is a perfectly normal response to public speaking, it is definitely not an easy task at all. But then in these kind of situations, it is very hard to open yourself to criticism, error and critique. Not sure how this can/should be addressed though?"
00:02:09,"Fiona Hilferty",annotation,student,null,"Hattie claims here that a teacher's fundamental job is to evaluate your instruction and the impact of your instruction. This is a powerful statement that casts teachers in the role of learners and orients teaching practice towards continual improvement."
----,"Jesse Cale",comment,student,,"Great Talk! It is refreshing to see a focus on teacher engagement. I think this is often lost in a majority of discussions about student learning. I guess the million dollar question is how, or is it possible, everyone can be an engaging, effective and passionate teacher?"
00:07:07,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Building trust","Building the trust within the whole class- this is not just building trust between student and teacher, but also amongst students, so they don't feel judged. I agree this is very important, and probably takes some time to build up. How can I do this with just 2 lectures a semester ? (as a guest lecturer) Maybe getting some discussion going on Moodle before my lecture. I always invite students to comment and ask questions as the lecture progresses, but they won't do this if the trust isn't there."
00:03:04,"Fiona Hilferty",annotation,student,null,"I like Hattie's claim that teachers who see themselves as change agents can make a difference. This is an active (almost activist), passionate role and it is one that I'd like to play in the classroom - particularly when contrasted with a more passive facilitator role."

I'm sure if I was sitting up the back I couldn't see.I assume this lecture is to teaching professionals, but for me his talk is difficult to understand because it contains quite a bit of jargon."
00:07:41,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Learning occurs through errors","Learning occurs through errors and errors should certainly be encouraged. That mistakes are bad is something that people may learn from a very early childhood, so it may  be hard to break that conditioning.

----,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",comment,student,,"The main points for me were: 1. Teachers have the power to be change agents- be active teachers. Active teachers get feedback, teach students to speak up, set challenging goals and tasks. You have to change your mindset.2. Listening is extremely important- listening to your students and peers. 3. Tests and assessments are not about the kids - they are for you as a teacher to learn about how well you have taught what to whom.4. Its important to build trust and rapport within the classroom. I think this is very important in a university setting where students are from different backgrounds and are often unfamiliar with each other. 5. Classrooms where error is welcomed is where learning occurs.6.Evidence based teaching is about collecting evidence about yourself as  a teacher (reflective teaching is limiting because you do not see everything that is happening in the classroom).  Overall I liked this presentation. Prof Hattie is very passionate and makes some  good points that I can take away."
----,"Fiona Hilferty",comment,student,null,"In parts of this video Hattie refers to the corresponding role of teacher and student - both to fulful the role of active learner in the classroom and to seek feedback. In this way the student and teacher roles are not opposing and contrasting. This makes me think of the beginning of the video where Hattie says the aim of the teacher should be to get into the mind of the student - a task that is easier to achieve when you share goals."

----,"Julianna Walton",comment,student,,"I found this excerpt hard to follow without the first part of the lecture. Some good observations though about building trust in a classroom so students feel confident to admit they don't know something. Toleration of error by teacher is possibly pretty well accepted but his reference to making sure that applies to  other students as well is great."
----,"Caroline Wake",comment,student,,"Firstly, Hattie's presentation reminded me that, at it's best, teaching is a calling and that teachers should bring that sense of mission and purpose into the room. I also like his points about teachers modelling humility and curiosity, building trust not only between teacher and student but also between students, and thus creating a space in which everyone can make mistakes together. That said, I think that at other times tertiary teaching is not a calling but an industry (with an oversupply of cheap labour, high rates of casualisation etc). Most days, the reality is somewhere in the middle: not a calling, not an industry, just a profession. Like my colleagues, it's the professional skills I need help with - not the passion, which is what brought me into the profession in the first place.Secondly, there seems to be a distinct gender bias to his description of and preference for certain models of teaching: strong agents for change vs organic facilitators sounds very gendered to me.
