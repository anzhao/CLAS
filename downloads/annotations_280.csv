00:00:21,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,"'Effective process feeds content'","Interesting comment, and I think this is true. This also links with our earlier sessions on flipped classrooms and how to make teaching more interactive and engaging."
00:01:02,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,reflection,"Yes, ask students to reflect in lectures."
00:02:53,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,flipped,"Yes, this is a flipped classroom model where students are discussing a case. I could do this more - and this also goes back to the process drives content comment."
00:00:27,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,"Process vs content","I am now at this stage of my teaching, realising the difference between focusing on process vs content"
00:01:19,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,"being in tune with the audience","I like the fact that he sees them as his audience rather than his 'pupils'"
00:03:08,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"I sensed that the example was probably was a good one but cant tell since a fraction was shown to us.I can see that showing a clip and asking them to discuss it is a good way to engage students"
00:03:46,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"it is always wise to have an option B"
----,"Apo Demirkol",comment,student,,"I like the presenter's attitude and reflections. It resonated with my experience as I now feel that the process is more important than the content because as he says good process would feed into content"
00:00:15,"Riza Sunindijo",annotation,student,"Content vs. Process","Effective process feeds content"
00:00:59,"Riza Sunindijo",annotation,student,"Reflective questions","Engaging students to make sure that they understand the principles"
00:03:00,"Riza Sunindijo",annotation,student,"Personalised learning experience","Activities to engage students and promote personalised learning experience, helping students to conceptualise"
----,"Riza Sunindijo",comment,student,,"Some key points from the video:- Pay attention on the process, not solely focusing on the content. Excellent content with poor process, e.g., delivery, will result in poor learning outcome- Use reflective questions to engage students and to make sure that they understand the principles- Do not hesitate to try activities, but at the same time it is good to have plan B"
00:01:05,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"Challenging but rewarding I imagine. This is a real performance"
----,"Mark Braidwood",comment,student,,"I've often wondered if teachers should take acting classes. This is because this sort of lecture is a real performance and engaging people is key, which is what actors are trained to do. It would require much self confidence in public speaking/presentation skills, which not everyone has. What about the introverts out there? But I think the rewards are there for both presenter and audience if done well."
00:00:03,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"In the middle","I like how he isn't behind a lecturn - that he physically stands amongst his audience."
00:00:30,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"'Whaadya reckon? Why is that?'","He treats each lecture like a big workshop."
00:00:54,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"Be flexible","This is a hard one. There is content to deliver but he 'loves seeing where students take things'. There's a balancing act here."
00:03:08,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"You Tube videos","Yes. Some students learn visually. Videos can be engaging and fun (funny so they add levity). However, the point of the activity can be lost on students if the ensuing discussion isn't briefed properly as was the case in the video - unless this was edited out in the video."
----,"Tom Kramer",comment,student,,"I agree that process is more important than content. However, it's important not to lose the aim of the class. Student engagement is one thing but we're not in the entertainment industry. Nevertheless, I like the idea that he treats classes as big workshops rather than a delivery vehicle, involving students at every turn."
00:01:18,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,,"Despite the high student engagement he seems to have achieved, I wonder if some students might feel that he should focus more on getting through the content? Some students are anxious if they think that the content isn't being covered in enough depth. If a lot of the lecture time is spent on exploring individual student questions, will all students find this satisfying and effective use of their lecture time?"
00:02:58,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,,"Certainly not a dull monotone droning voice delivering a long lecture! The activity creates energy in the room and challenges students to think and get involved in the problem they've been set."
----,"Niki Fardouly",comment,student,,"The process is critical for engaging students but the content and process must both be aligned with the outcomes so that students don't feel that their time has been wasted. He does seem like a bit of an extrovert who is comfortable putting on a performance and providing some entertainment. There is nothing wrong with that if you can do it but many lecturers aren't comfortable in that role. It would be good to hear how that type of academic copes and achieves the same sort of engagement."
00:01:10,"Alishia Williams",annotation,student,,"I think being able to walk away from the lectern and interact with students assists with engagement. Shame not all lecture rooms accommodate this with recording devices! This lecturer clearly has a well-developed rapport with his class  - which I assume took awhile to build."
00:01:18,"Alishia Williams",annotation,student,,"It would be helpful to know what other strategies -aside from nods-he uses to gauge understanding, particularly if students are not verabally responsive."
----,"Alishia Williams",comment,student,,"I think some of the best lecturers are definitely 'entertaining' to the extent that they can engage student's interest in the content to facilitate learning. Although I have seen those who focus too much on being charismatic and likeable to the detriment of the learning experience!"
00:00:22,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Effective process breeds content","I think I am where he was- focused on content. As a guest lecturer, I feel there are a number of points I need to cover, and shouldn't deviate from these. However, its not about reducing the content, but delivering it in engaging ways (eg. video) so that the students get more out of it."
00:01:00,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,,"His style of teaching encourages noise and discussion, and engages students. It's unlike traditional styles of lecturing. His classes seem like lots of fun!"
00:01:55,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Pepsi ad","Fantastic use of contemporary video clip to engage students."
00:02:46,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Lets make lots of noise","I showed a You Tube video in my last lecture, it was a great way of demonstrating visually what I had been rabitting on about. However we didn't discuss afterwards, I really like this format and would like to try it next time. I would be worried though that students: (1) wouldn't talk, (b) would talk about things that aren't relevant, or (3) we would run out of time and that is my one and only lecture to them (no chance for follow-up ... except online)."
00:03:26,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Have some back-up options","Good advice- have a plan B in case plan A is a complete flop."
----,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",comment,student,,"I really like Giuseppe's style of lecturing. The students are happy and engaged, and encouraged to make lots of noise/discussion. He interacts with them at their level, and comes right into the crowd, instead of standing at the front behind the lecturn. The key points for me were Process rather than Content (focus on how to best deliver the message rather than stressing what you're actually saying. We all know our topics really well, so its more about getting this information across effectively) and using an activity such as a video. I used a You Tube clip in my last lecture and it went  well. The Pepsi ad is a great example though as its contemporary, short and funny. The students all engage in lively discussion. For me this would be a dream come true! :)"
00:01:46,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"Great lecturer! It's a really great free flowing style. I still can't get over the fact that people will read powerpoints for a two hour lecture! He really is a good example of dynamic lecturing"
00:03:27,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"I like this idea too - where he argues to have backup options for activities, sometimes an activity may not work simply due to group dynamics and even moods of students on a given day. It's ok that something may not work all of the time, but it is important to be prepared."
00:03:36,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"I like the idea he conveys here: not every activity may work as well all of the time: the key is to be prepared."
----,"Jesse Cale",comment,student,,"I agree with the statement made by Tom above: I think there is a fine line between dynamic teaching and entertainment that needs to be considered. I've worked in colleges in North America where instructors have minimal content knowledge but are great and dynamic speakers. The problem is in some cases they completely misrepresent the substantive content. The scary thing is that many students seemed willing to overlook this even if they discover the mistakes and give quite glowing evaluations..."
00:00:21,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I like that he recognises that the process is more important than the content. I think if you approach learning and teaching with the mindset of ""what skills do I want to teach"" it actually makes figuring out the content much easier and more effective."
00:00:27,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"Yes! Active teaching is far more engaging, especially when tied to a real world context"
00:00:45,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I think it's really important to have a more global approach to teaching. I'd love to see more integration between academics who teach different year courses, so that continuity of content through a degree is maintained."
00:01:21,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"how does he check if they understand the concepts?"
00:03:04,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"I would sat a youtube clip is not so much a ""personalised 1-1 experience"" but more a tool to draw in student interest because the content might be more appropriate to their level of understanding"
00:03:19,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"comes back to curriculum alignment and continuity."
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,,"I completely agree with his teaching style, but I question his definition of personalised learning. To me, personalised means that each student has the chance to engage with the content in a unique way, not a unique way of engaging with the content, for all students the same way. I do like that there is a greater emphasis on aligning content with objectives. We talk a lot about flipping the classroom, but why don't we flip the preparation - outcomes first, then content. Probably the term is not so catchy..."
00:01:16,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"good example of his use of comedy and brevity to keep students interested and engaged"
00:02:42,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"nice way of transitioned from 'lecture' format to 'seminar'/forum format"
00:03:23,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"this point is not a representative or good example of 'personalised learning'"
----,"Josh Wodak",comment,student,,"Overall I didn't find him (or at least this video of him) to be representative or a good example of 'personalised learning' - it was barely mentioned in the video and the actual example didn't seem to be personalised at all"
00:00:53,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"""see where the students take things"" - I agree, but often get student feedback that they dislike 'getting sidetracked' or 'off-topic'. So I think it's important to ensure at the start of the course that the in-class approach will involve sidetracking, if relevant to the course materials. Expectations management is important"
00:00:21,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"""Effective process feeds content"". Agree with some of the other comments posted that the pendulum can swing too far in favour of process, at the expense of content, and that as teachers we need to be aware of this. Particularly w.r.t. the 'keep the students engaged' which can often simply mean keep them entertained."
----,"Jeff Coulton",comment,student,,"He likes to ""see where the students take things"" - I agree, but often get student feedback that they dislike 'getting sidetracked' or 'off-topic'. So I think it's important to ensure at the start of the course that the in-class approach will involve sidetracking, if relevant to the course materials. Expectations management is important."
00:00:59,"Matthew Woolley",annotation,student,,"""where students take things"" &amp;hellip; they could take things in unhelpful directions as often as not, and there's often limited time ..."
00:03:09,"Matthew Woolley",annotation,student,,"""video clip and peer-to-peer discussion"". Perhaps most helpful where the ""right answer"" is unclear or at least rather subjective &amp;hellip; perhaps only useful at levels beyond undergraduate in the hard sciences"
----,"Matthew Woolley",comment,student,,"As others have noted, it is perhaps a little dangerous to see ""where students take things"" when time is limited. The peer-to-peer discussion is perhaps most helpful where the ""right answer"" is rather subjective, which is perhaps only true beyond the undergraduate level in the hard sciences."
00:02:21,"Mahmoud Efatmaneshnik",annotation,student,,"It might be that creating an open environment will create the possibility to personalised learning, however, if balance is not observed, this can easily lead to no one learning learning nothing, rather than every one learning everything that is in the course."
00:01:25,"Fatima Afzal",annotation,student,,"engaging students successfully"
00:02:01,"Fatima Afzal",annotation,student,,"engaging students to do discussions is effective but could be challenging"
----,"Fatima Afzal",comment,student,,"i Like the teacher's attitude. I think if your content is high level but you fail to deliver it, you fail as a teacher. Engaging students during the lecture make them more interested in knowing more."
----,"Zhe An",comment,student,"Content v.s. process","Content v.s. process: I think his teaching method focus on student learnings experiences. Once learnings process is going well, learnings outcomes will be good indeed."
