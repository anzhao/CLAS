00:00:59,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"Standards based assessment only works if the feedback is relevant to the outcome the student receives."
00:02:37,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"Normative assessment reminds me of the HSC and the world of ""scaled"" marks. What is the universities policy on scaling of marks within their own courses? Is there one? Can you have a normative and standards based assessment as one thing?"
00:02:57,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"Criterion references marking is used quite a bit in the Medicine course with the viva voce exams."
00:06:19,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"Often understanding the context to which something is applied is poorly addressed. For example, I did medical science as an undergrad and had to do mathematics. I learnt about matrices, and a number of other things, but never was it made clear how this actually dovetailed into the higher level courses offered in years two and three, let alone once I finished uni. Too often courses exist as single entities and don't address how prerequisite courses fit together."
00:07:54,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,,"To what extent do we need to demonstrate examples of criteria such as ""excellent communication of ideas"". Each student would have a varied appreciation of what this means and how if is achieved. How do we make sure that each student achieves a consistent base of understanding of what a poor, or excellent submission looks like?"
00:01:29,"Patricia Arthur",annotation,student,,"The assessments task drive the learning: this may be so, but I still get students looking for marks, not outcomes."
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,,"There are two issues that I thought about during this video:1. Application of knowledge to context: I think it is good if course leads take ownership of their courses to make them as good as they can be, but at the same time, it is sometimes very difficult to find the relevance of some courses within a degree if a student has a good idea of what they want to major in. For example, if I was doing a science degree specialising in Anatomy, why should I need to know about higher maths? I think there needs to be a greater understanding of context within a course as well as BETWEEN courses so that students can see how it all fits together.2. Standards for assessment: I think everyone has different perceptions of their own level of performance, but how do you ensure all students can understand what it means to have ""substantial originality"" and other statements students encounter in rubrics and marking guides?"
00:03:17,"Patricia Arthur",annotation,student,,"I am still struggling with how an competency based programme - Optometry - can be anything other than competency based in the majority of contexts."
00:08:23,"Patricia Arthur",annotation,student,,"Exactly, how do you explain an HD to students when they are trying to prepare their work when it appears to be some thing that the academic recognises, but can't really articulate themselves! Is this an unattainable objectivity?"
00:09:44,"Patricia Arthur",annotation,student,,"Using the same table/rubric may seem to be fair, but it still does not prescribe equitable marking across a group of markers."
----,"Patricia Arthur",comment,student,,"I hope that I can become more of a believer in the rubric. To date, my experience of it in a scientific course has been less than encouraging. It may well have been the way it was designed and I hope to learn how to do it better than what I have seen."
00:02:32,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"The policy in the school I taught in is very clearly to not aspire to a 'bell curve' in final grades, but it still felt to me as though the practice 'on the ground' was to be aiming for final grades to sort of 'naturally' end up looking like that. I certainly didn't have questions asked, but I was surprised that during the course, students really did improve significantly in their performance from the first to the last major assessment, which meant there were more Ds and HDs than might have been 'expected'. I like to think this was because they really learnt something, engaged well and came up with final assessments we can all be proud of! But as a novice teacher, I still felt as though I'd be tapped on the shoulder to ask what went wrong! That didn't happen, but I still feel that the bell curve notion persists, especially in really big courses..."
00:07:49,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I found that it was often hardest to explain the difference between D and HD standards, even though I could 'intuit' it - hardly helpful for students!"
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"I think the case for standards based assessment is clear, and contributes not only to clarifying expectations for students, but forcing teachers to be incredibly sure about what they are trying to achieve, whether that is fair, and how students can be better supported to understand and achieve the best possible standards for their own capabilities. I think I still feel a bit unsure about whether that means we should be aiming for all students to do brilliantly or assuming there will always be a real mix, but I guess the point is that every part of the matrix needs to make sense, and then it's up to the students (and us) to make the most of it!"

----,"Meng Tok",comment,student,,"&ldquo;Trapping students in a web of learning&rdquo; I hope we can all achieve this goal for our students.To me it seems the criteria based assessment is similar to the standards based assessment. The difference it seems is performance standard which can be hard to define depending on what one is assessing. Coming from medicine where it is both an art as well as a science, standard based assessment will work really well but the difficulty lies in aligning the learning outcome to the assessment task. As medical students, I was told anything/everything can be tested."
00:03:14,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,,"I could never quite understand the difference between criterion referenced and standards-based. Margot is saying that the difference is the quality levels. So I guess in Moodle, the marking sheet is criterion referenced assessment and the rubric is standards-based assessment"
00:09:29,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,,"I've heard some academics say that they use rubrics for marking but they won't release them to students to see before attempting an assessment task. They think it will only encourage students to perform to the requirements of the rubric. I think what they mean is that the rubric will reveal how to do the task correctly and students won't be demonstrating what they really know because they've kind of already been given the 'correct answer'. Does this mean that they've designed their assessments and their rubrics badly, or they've misunderstood what a rubric is, or do they have outdated ideas about what is the role of assessment and feedback?"
----,"Niki Fardouly",comment,student,,"I think it's important to train students to understand how to use rubrics and how to evaluate and give peer feedback. As my recent experience showed me in using a rubric for a peer assessment task, it's easy to misinterpret the rubric statements if they are not specific enough or don't provide examples of different levels of performance that students can compare and analyse. Students will just apply their own particular interpretation and understanding so there will not be any consistency in how the rubric is used. Therefore using a rubric without preparing students for this task, will not guarantee a good outcome."
00:03:34,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"Helps ensure consistency across markers as well"
00:07:06,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"Still seems subjective - what does adequate mean? These need to be defined"
00:09:34,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"IF assessemnt drives what student's learn, then it makes sense to publish the rubric, to help align them"
----,"Mark Braidwood",comment,student,,"I still feel that these standards are open to interpretation if used across different markers. Might it help to provide examples of the baseline competency that is being described? Then performances can be compared to that.  Agree that it would need to be sensitive to context."
00:02:38,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,"Bell curves","Her comments about bell curves, and how these don't enable us to see whether students have understood and learnt reiterates earlier material we've studied."
00:04:38,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,"Taxonomy and rubric","Using this taxonomy of learning - going back to the first module - seems a useful basis of a rubric."
00:09:13,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,rubrics,"Interesting - design the rubric before designing assessment - can help inform the assessment."
----,"Sue Williamson",comment,student,rubrics,"Designing a rubric before - or when designing the assessment - seems like a useful idea. I hadn't thought of the process being iterative before - designing a rubric has always been a task I've done after everything else."
00:03:04,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"Oddly enough, I'm forced to use normative (bell curve) assessment in the courses where I typically have the most engaged students (AGSM MBA)!"
00:07:24,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"There's obviously more of a 'grey line' when making (as assessors) judgment calls on many of these assessment tasks. What is ""adequate"" for example...etc."
00:08:57,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,,"I get the feeling that a rubric would be improved by showing not just description of what poor, adequate etc performance would involve, but links to actual examples from previous iterations of a particular task."

00:03:31,"Klara Bruveris",annotation,student,standards,"standards-base assessment is an approach to assessing student work against pre-determined criteria and performance standards, so that students know the level of performance required for each assessment task. (by whose standards? universal, personal, institutional?)"
----,"Klara Bruveris",comment,student,,"I would like to understand more how criteria based assessment and standards-based assessment could be used collaboratively? It seems at UNSW in the courses I have been involved in that there is a combination of both in place."
00:06:50,"Stephen Doherty",annotation,student,,"I found these to be very clear and useful, and certainly caused me to think back on my courses."
----,"Stephen Doherty",comment,student,,"I'm sold on the need for SBA, but I'm curious as to how we as teachers can ensure that our colleagues and tutors are using the rubic effectively? I've found that having spent time on rubrics that were designed to give feedback to students, there always seem to be a handful of tutors who are oppossed to it, simply to not use it, etc. The training involved can be time consuming and issues of consistency and reliability need to be addressed, yet this time is not included in preparation or training other staff, so, at least for me, it's done out of my own personal time."
00:04:14,"Ben Silverstein",annotation,student,,"Standards based assessment can link the learning outcomes closely to their expression in the assessment task, in a way students can (hopefully) easily identify what is being assessed in their work."
00:09:05,"Ben Silverstein",annotation,student,,"Explaining what is involved in a piece of work that gets an HD, or a D etc, can be really useful feedback to students who are trying to improve their work. It needs to be specific though, and I'm not sure the rubric would always allow that?"
----,"Ben Silverstein",comment,student,,"I can see how standards based assessment is useful, offering students a better sense of how their work is going and where they can improve, with more shades of grey than in a criterion reference assessment. I wonder, though, whether a rubric of this kind can sufficiently convey to students a strong sense of where they stand: examples and specific feedback also seem necessary."
00:01:47,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"interesting observation re students priorities in looking at assessments before other course information"
00:03:39,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"it would seem to be common sense that all three of the learning critiera would use pre determined critiera"
----,"Josh Wodak",comment,student,,"Standards Based Assessment does sound very sound and appealing - the relevance for peer assessment and iterative process seem like it provides a good balance between structure and flexibility re how the SBA is designed and implemented"
00:08:30,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,,"The difficulty associated with explaining the different mark levels is an important point, I think - while I think setting out standards is a good assessment approach, I'm not sure how well students always understand these descriptions, unless they're fairly factual things."
00:05:39,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,,"The idea of meta-cognition is interesting - this isn't something I've thought about in designing my assessment tasks previously..."
00:02:34,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"Yes, the bell curve. I think there is still some pressure to have you marks fit some kind of a bell curve, which is problematic.."
00:03:33,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"yes, this is good for transparency; and arguably takes some pressure of markers, in the sense that the marks they give are clearly justfied"
----,"Laura Crommelin",comment,student,,"I have a couple of questions coming out of this.  First, how can we design assessment to encourage the 'meta-cognitive' process described in the video?  This sounds very valuable but isn't an idea I've encountered before.  Second, how do we ensure rubrics are actually meaningful for students? My concern with them is they tend to be a bit vague or conceptual - e.g. the students who know what critical evaluation is will likely do it anyway, while this doesn't offer much for those students who don't."
00:03:26,"Matthew Woolley",annotation,student,,"There's still a question of the universality of standards. An attempt at standardising everything might limit the individuality of courses, and lead students to address only the material described in these narrowly-defined standards."
----,"Matthew Woolley",comment,student,,"There's perhaps a danger in students focusing on narrowly-defined standards, rather than seeing the content of the course as a whole. An excessive focus on standards could also limit the individuality of courses, and there's also the question of who is setting the standard and how consistently this can be applied."
00:02:24,"Julianna Walton",annotation,student,,"Bell curve is not something I have been asked to do, thank goodness."
00:03:24,"Julianna Walton",annotation,student,,"Competency based assessment remains very strong in industry training field. It probably works well enough for lots of occupations but sits oddly with any situation where extent of mastery really does matter."
00:01:40,"Marcel Scharth",annotation,student,,"It's an interesting observation that the students tend to read the assessment information before other items in the course guides. It's then important to make an extra effort to link the assessment tasks with the learning outcomes in that section of the guide."
----,"Julianna Walton",comment,student,,"I think students are likely to respond very positively to really helpful information about assessment from the get-go. Rubrics are a really good way to convey that information so long as they are written in plain English for that audience. Having used a rubric with a colleague I agree entirely that the process can be iterative - it can become crystal clear that the learning outcomes need adjustment once you have thought it through to the end. Unfortunately, course learning outcomes are set well before the lecturers are signed up and changing the course learning outcomes is a very big deal."
00:05:51,"Dianne Anagnos",annotation,student,,"Trying hard to adapt these ideas to my practice-based courses.  The problem is that each student is going to have a different experience/different clients/different problems to work on, so the 'standards' we assess on have to be fairly flexible."
00:09:50,"Dianne Anagnos",annotation,student,,"Rubrics aren't just useful for the markers, they're essential in providing both guidance and transparency for students."
----,"Dianne Anagnos",comment,student,,"Standards are important both for guiding the student towards what they're meant to be achieving in the assessment task, and in providing transparency(and legitimacy) to the assessment process."
00:03:29,"Marcel Scharth",annotation,student,,"While I'm convinced that SBA is a good approach, I don't think we should be dismissive of normative and criterion referenced assessment. In mathematical subjects, for example, there may be a reasonable expectation that marks will follow a bell curve based on experience.  In the case of criterion referenced assessment, we may need to consider other stakeholders too (which is why it is used in fields like medicine)."
----,"Marcel Scharth",comment,student,,"I never thought about designing a rubric for a written exam, but this podcast has inspired me to consider it. Even if I discuss with the students what they should focus on for the exam, it does not seem to have the desired effect. At that point they tend to focus on the content, rather than on the learning outcomes."
----,"Forrest Duxbury",comment,student,,"This is an interesting video, but like most rubrics, it sounds great in a theoretical sense but the benefits may be harder to realise when implemented for the first time. I believe rubrics need to be well-defined for the lowest common denominator student, essentially by designing the language well but also by providing completed examples."
00:01:46,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"true! they do look at the assessment tasks first"
00:06:31,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"I think these tips are quite useful"
----,"Apo Demirkol",comment,student,,"i like the idea of a standard based assessment. in a course where there is not  a principle teacher, then it looks like it is the DIG that need to take this on board"
00:02:08,"Mark Reed",annotation,student,,"interesting to know there are different approaches to assessment"
00:09:08,"Mark Reed",annotation,student,,"I think the idea of rubrics is a good one- I have used them and the students benefit from knowing the details of the assessment"
----,"Md. Hossain",comment,student,,"I agree with the concept of the video; setting some standards for assessment. It will certainly help the students and provide them an overall guideline how to present their learning and how to improve them."
00:03:04,"Serge Gaspers",annotation,student,,"Standards based assessment seems the most reasonable amongst the 3 approaches to assessment."
00:07:13,"Serge Gaspers",annotation,student,,"How important is the quality of writing in a technical subject (e.g., computer science)?"
----,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",comment,student,,"I think the argument for standards based assessment is pretty straight forward. However, I don't think describing these standards in an unambiguous manner (to the students) is a straight forward matter. Also, I'm not sure if all students would be motivated/driven by a suitable rubric. Some, perhaps many, certainly would but are these the same students who would strive to do well in the course regardless of whether standards based assessment was employed or not?"
00:02:36,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,,"Is there any reasonable basis for a bell curve of performance? I don't think it is a suitable assessment methodology but I am curious as to its origins."
00:03:37,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,,"What happens when there is a mismatch between a student's interpretation of the level of performance required and that of the teacher?"

00:01:34,"Maggie Hu",annotation,student,,"Very true. students are eager to know what they can do to increase their mark and final score."
----,"Maggie Hu",comment,student,,"To me somehow, criterion referenced assessment is not much different from standards-based learning. both of these two assessment types involve criteria or standards, and compare the students' performance against them."
00:01:15,"Fiona Hilferty",annotation,student,null,"I think this point on curriculum alignment is key. Standards assessment relies upon well-defined outcomes that can be achieved. This makes assessment not so much about individual judgement."

00:01:44,"Johannes Luetz",annotation,student,"assessment guides","In my experience not all students look at the assessment guidelines in detail - in fact, many do not seem to be aware of them until -after- the deadline has come and gone..."
----,"Yun Hau Ng",comment,student,,"I have been using Rubrics for the report/essay/writing assessment. I think it provides student clear guidelines of expectations. It also applies standard and transparency. However, at some points, I think it is more helpful for the lecturers to significantly reduce the marking time by jumping into the ""marking criteria"". Students may not pay extra effort as well because they develop the skills to address the criteria in order to score well."
00:05:53,"Johannes Luetz",annotation,student,"In reality this is rarely explained...","In my experience, in reality lecturers do not typically spend time explaining factual, conceptual, procedural and meta-cognitive types of learning outcomes. While this seems important and relevant, does the university system value this ""intrinsically""?"
00:03:40,"Fiona Hilferty",annotation,student,null,"Otcomes based education is an approach to education where teaching and learning decisions are driven by the outcomes the students should display at the end of the course or program. Because this form of education ensures that learning outcomes will be specified upfront, the standards based assessment model aligns perfectly."
00:08:26,"Johannes Luetz",annotation,student,"Intrinsic importance?","I wonder how much ""intrinsic"" value the university system places on really explaining to students the meaning and relevance of factual, conceptual, procedural and meta-cognitive types of learning outcomes. While this seems important and relevant, does the university system really value this ""intrinsically"" and systemically? Not sure..."
00:01:43,"Juan Pablo Escobedo-Diaz",annotation,student,assessment,"I agree, the first thing my students check on the course outline is the ""value"" or weight for each assessment item (HW, exam, tut, etc.)"
----,"Juan Pablo Escobedo-Diaz",comment,student,"Assessment and feedback","Having experienced issues due to the assessment on a course I was co-teaching last semester, I believe setting clear and easy to understand rules, in the form of a rubric,  of how the students will be assessed makes the course runs smoother."
----,"Johannes Warouw",comment,student,"Types of learning  outcomes","Types of learning outcomes seem to be clear and useful to guide  lecturer to prepare assessment component, but finding ways to explain the rubric to students may be another issue that's not easy to do."
00:01:08,"Prudence Gibson",annotation,student,"student POV","I appreciate standards based assessment theories but wonder how to make these concepts available to students, so they can develop their point of view alongside the pedagogy, rather than lagging behind the implementation?"
----,"Prudence Gibson",comment,student,"rubric info upfront","The rubrics should definitely be available to students at the offset of the course. There is no merit in suggestion this will give students nay kind of advantage or prior knowledge."
----,"Prudence Gibson",comment,student,"normative assessment","I have been concerned by the trouble that each semester, each course, there is a totality of each group as a set cohort. Being assessed against a cohort in a normative environment might artificially raise or lower a student's marks, due to the strength of the group at any one point in time."
00:00:30,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Anecdotally, around 85% of exams with detailed feedback / marking rubrics attached to them go uncollected at the Law Faculty. One can't help but feel it is a lot of work gone to waste."
00:01:37,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"It does happen very often that students who are struggling with a part of a course will ask whether the topic will be assessable - if it is not, they will not bother trying to overcome their difficulties."
00:02:38,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Yes, we have moved away from curves. But there is still such a thing as a ""mark distribution range"", which are bands within which we still need to operate. Same ideas, new clothing?"
00:06:21,"Prudence Gibson",annotation,student,knowledge,"It is interesting to consider how to develop, apply and present student knowledge as a continuous process, rather than a static one. Perhaps there is room within the core criteria to extend the standards within the context of the classroom, adapting to the variety of students in the cohort, and adapting the criteria to adapt to that variety."
00:08:37,"Prudence Gibson",annotation,student,HD,"I'm not sure why it is so difficult to articulate why an HD is an HD in terms of creativity. Creativity should be an equivalent criteria element within all the grade structures. An HD version of creativity is just an advanced and sophisticated version of that creativity."
----,"Lucas Lixinski",comment,student,,"Rubrics are great, but a LOT of work. That said, in courses taught across several groups simultaneously, it is one of the few ways to ensure any form of consistency."
