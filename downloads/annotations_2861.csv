----,"Carolien van Ham",comment,student,"Carolien van Ham","I love this video! The idea that exams are evaluations of how well we are doing in promoting student learning, and the idea of us collecting evidence about our performance on an ongoing basis, creating trust in a class-room so that feedback can be given from students to teacher and vice versa, is very nice."
00:05:12,"Heath Pratt",annotation,student,Feedback,"Feedback works best when the student doesn't know how they have gone.  This is a simple concept but so true and is so easily forgotten.

He claims that the teacher's attitude and mindset as a change agent impacts more on the effectiveness of their teaching than their content knowledge or strategies. He also encourages teachers to challenge students rather than simply cover the curriculum. Hattie is very thought provoking - especially focussing on the power of the teacher in a learner centred classroom."

----,"Sonia Graham",comment,student,,"This video talks about the importance of feedback for helping both teachers and students by making learning visible. Feedback works best when students don't know how they've gone. Teaching works best when it involves regular feedback. Hence, John asks his sons each day, what feedback did you get today?In order to make feedback honest and effective there needs to be a culture of trust. It also requires teachers to be active and desire to be a change agent in the classroom."
00:10:44,"Mariam Farida",annotation,student,"active teachers","I found John Hattie's video very honest and straight to the point. it is hard to be a teacher and takes a lot of energy and dedication. the few points that I can take from his talk which I think are essential for teaching, and are what I try to keep note of are:1-the role of teachers as evaluators, that is teachers must know who the exams or activities they are giving are for, to know how to manage to give the students the assessments that reflect their knowledge2-for teachers to have a mindset to be realistic, and to propose challenging tasks so that students can be encouraged and supported. I try to reflect this in my classes, in which I always try to encourage students to think out of the box and maybe propose  research goals that gets them to ask big questions3- feedback is powerful, I agree with John, because teachers tend to go on with their routine without actually stopping and asking, am I doing the right thing? are students learning? but then feedback comes to answer that, peer evaluation or students' evaluation, or even informal students in class evaluation always helps, where you just have a chat with students ask them how they are going about with their studying. this can help a lot.4- another final point, is building the trust with the students, I remember I had a student last year where she wouldn't participate much but I can notice that she is interacting with the subject, so I approached her and asked her and then she had told me that she felt shy because she didn't want to look like a fool in class. I thanked her for sharing this and encouraged her to participate and that in this classroom all opinions are welcome and all errors are ok. we are here to learn. I was happy after that because she did participate and ended up with a distinction. so I think it is important to build the trust so that students will feel the good environment to share and learn!"
----,"Mariam Farida",comment,student,"active teachers","I think what John said was very honest and I agree with him on the following points:1-teachers must build trust with students so that a student can feel that they can make an error and that its ok because they are here to learn and they are not expected to know about everything2-teachers must not take evaluation for granted, it is always healthy to pause and ask/reflect if they teacher is doing everything right or if students are struggling with something3- teachers need to evaluate their own structures, exams, content..etc.. the course outcome must meet the student's abilities 4- teachers need to have a mindset to challenge students and encourage them to be active learners and to engage."

I find this, however, not to be necessary at other more advanced stages like, for instance, university level.In my opinion, there is clearly a need for differentiating between teacher's attitudes and strategies depending on the context in which the learning activity takes place. At the university level, at which I work, I think other aspects like for instance being proficient on the topics that you explain, is by far more important than, for instance, creating a relationship with students. In order to define good teaching strategies or attitudes, I think that one necessarily must consider the context in which the related activities are going to take place."

Feedback should be focused on constructive criticism designed to help them develop higher level skills apply knowledge. There is no point for feedback if it focuses entirely either on the easy things you have done correctly or likes and perhaps more importantly if there is no applicable structure/content to the feedback"
00:06:58,"Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook",annotation,student,,"The concept of building trust with the entire class so that you can get honest feedback from students but also so that they allow each other to give that critical feedback is very rare but something that I have seen the benefits in my own teaching, on the occasions that it occurs"
----,"Kathryn Hutton-Bedbrook",comment,student,,"The points that most resonated with my in this clip is firstly that the feedback should be focused on actually helping the students improve. That classrooms where error is encouraged is something that I try to encourage in my classes and it has excellent consequences when I have managed to build the trust and students do feel comfortable questioning and discussing. Finally the idea of building trust so the students are comfortable with you and each other in order to allow this questioning is a very strong point"

----,"Julie Thoms",comment,student,,"I think that the idea of tolerating error is very important &ndash; for the teacher as much as the student. It can be very easy to want to always get positive feedback, but as Hattie states, change comes in identifying what we are not doing very well. I also like the idea that it is in challenging situations that feedback becomes important, and even desired by the student. Finally, I agree that the mindset of the teacher is critical &ndash; as we progress through FULT it is increasingly obvious that good teaching requires a great deal of passion and commitment. This is particularly challenging in my own field where research is seen as the primary task (and really is what counts in terms of getting the grants which are required for ongoing employment) and teaching is typically an annoying extra task that is done in the minimal possible time."

Also the message is for teachers to invest more time and energy into their teaching to challenge students and build relationships in the class to create an atmosphere that welcomes learning."
00:01:22,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"How to we hear what students are learning?","I like this idea, trying to stop talking at the students and listen to what they are learning. I've never really thought about evalution this way. I've always been more of a 'talker' asking the students if they have grasped the concepts rather than listening."
00:05:13,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,Feedback,"This resonates with me because I have always felt that I learnt better from feedback on a tough question that I got wrong than on the easier stuff that I got right.

00:02:55,"Natalie Ross",annotation,student,,"I agree with Prof Hattie's statement that the teacher's mindset is really important.

To leave everything to the lecturer would discourage them to improve the teaching style."
----,"Heath Pratt",comment,student,"Mistakes are just Important as Success","I took away some interesting, and to be quite honest, crucial realisations as a result of watching the video. The video highlighted important issues that I had previously suspected but until now had not had specifically addressed in this way before. The realisation that evaluation is in fact a two way street is enlightening. It is just important, if not more important for the teacher than to the student. I found the video&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on the requirement for teachers to adopt a paradigm shift in order to see evaluation as feedback to the education deliverer and not just feedback for participating students.I also found the video refreshing as it encourages teachers to step out of their comfort zone before asking the student to step out of theirs. Hattie emphasises the fact that we learn just as much, if not more from our mistakes then from our successes. More specifically he challenges teachers to set evaluation that is challenging. He suggests that easy evaluation may undermine the learning experience for students and the development of their mental models that underpins deep learning. Both the teacher and the students should realise that effective feedback can take the form of both positive and negative reinforcement. Furthermore, the educational relationship should be one of trust upon which positive and negative reinforcement, in the form of feedback, is well received and it is then that the feedback becomes effective."
