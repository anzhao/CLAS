00:00:32,"Gianfranco Giuntoli",annotation,student,"Knowledge worth","Discourses around the value of things and knowledge are always relative to power relations, perspectives, social roles and positions, so it is important to keep this in mind when evaluating the answers that are given to the question: what is worth learning for the next 20 years time."
00:00:58,"Gianfranco Giuntoli",annotation,student,"Unknown - Ignorance","We, as human beings, are sense-making creatures; we make sense of the world around us, including its unknown aspects, by referring to what we already know, i.e our stock of knowledge, which is socially and culturally based. Building a solid stock of knowledge in the social sciences is as important as learning strategies to use what we already know to interpret what we do not know or we do not understand yet."
00:02:08,"Gianfranco Giuntoli",annotation,student,"Looking outside discipline","Perking suggests that we should be teaching content looking for understandings of wide scope, that is not just the narrow, deep knowledge that characterises most disciplines, but how disciplines look outside themselves. I think that this is import to help to understand disciplines in relation to others and, more generally, their role in society."
00:01:00,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""Educating for the unknown"". I appreciate Professor Perkins' larger point about providing students with more ""nimble"" ways of thinking and interacting with our world. But in disciplinary subjects like science it often takes a long time to get to the ""unknown"". To get to that point, you have to learn to speak the language of the subject with which you are engaging."
00:02:29,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"I did not fully understand the point being made by the speaker here. Is he implying that we should restructure learning materials around the lives people live? That seems like a very narrow criterion by which to build a curriculum. That said, I agree that many subjects can speak to more than just their own disciplines."
00:00:41,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""What's worth learning?"" I'd love to know how some of our undergraduate students would answer this question!"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"An interesting point of view that raised several important questions. That said, I often it find to difficult to take these kinds of ideas and imagine what that would actually look like in the context of the ""harder"" subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics, and so on. I am hoping that this course will show me the way!"
00:00:36,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Who decides what is worth learning?"
00:01:02,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"In the arts we are already teaching for the unexpected, because our primary focus in on teaching students how to think, not what to think"
----,"Jessica Ford",comment,student,,"I have difficulty with the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I teach film and media studies and in my discipline, we focus on teaching students 'how' to think and not 'what' to think. Any amount of critical evaluation of written, verbal and visual texts that students gain through our courses is immensely valuable. We strongly encourage students to look critically at forms of media that make up their daily lives, such as music videos, social media, advertisements and television. Visual literacy in the contemporary era cannot be considered 'a waste of time'"

00:02:37,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,null,"I think it is important to teach fundamental princples to students as it gives them understanding of the topics we are teaching. There are basic princples that students will need to know when working as professional. We can not leave these out altoghether.Perhaps students should be giving more thought into what they want to study and where it will lead them in the future."
----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,PerkinsWash,"Fascinating comment on how curriculum is resistant to change and how teaching should look outside the discipline! The trans-disciplinary approach has been espoused in the past but it now seems that much academia is going back to being merely interdisciplinary? Prof Perkins indicates we should take the broadest scope approach."
00:00:55,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I teach International business, business planning and entrepreneurship, therefore I find the comment 'to teach for the unknown' particularly interesting. we need to equip our students for the workplace and world of tomorrow not today. This forward thinking, anticipating needs and almost forecasting is very important. we need to teach our students to adapt to a dynamic environment, to be 'street smart' and to think creatively out of the box."
00:02:29,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I find the comment about curriculum design also very interesting since we cannot teach students to connect the dots between different courses and subject matter if the programs and products we offer is inflexible and narrowly put together. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research needs to feed through to teaching as well. How to achieve this, however is another question."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,,"I found this a very interesting conversation. I will take away the following ideas: We need to prepare students for the unknown by including tools from different disciplines. This will enable them to draw on a wide knowledge base and utilise these tools in creative ways. Students also need to take responsibility of their personal learning journey."
00:01:13,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of what&rsquo;s worth learning. In science, technology is advancing quite rapidly. This means that the teaching focus should be changed to match these developments. Having said that, I don&rsquo;t think 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. In many disciplines you need to have an understanding of basic concepts before you can really do much."
00:01:10,"Paul Rogers",annotation,student,,"This annotation is for the point raised at around 1:13.I have previously taught a small online course, on creating portfolio websites for artists.There are two main issues with a course that has a technical component.1. There is always an initial technical barrier that must be addressed.2. The nature of any technology, is that it will change / grow / evolve over time.This means that there needs to be two focusses to pair with this idea. Breaking through the initial technical barrier, and then building transferrable skills and concepts that will grow beyond a course.I think the inevitability of change that goes hand-in-hand with technology pairs quite well with the model that education needs to adopt.Building upon transferrable and evolving skill sets, as well as ways of thinking."
00:01:11,"Paul Rogers",annotation,student,,"This is an interesting perspective, although a sweeping judgement that everything is ""typically poor"", and that anything that is relevant or well constructed is ""atypical"". This may be the case sometimes, but I am very wary to adopt this view myself. This view seems common to a lot of people I have personally met in the ""flipped"", or even ""educational development and design areas"".I do not want this view to continue to be adopted as it is unhelpful, and creates barriers to real change."

----,"Paul Rogers",comment,student,,"There are some very interesting ideas here, but I suppose nothing that I haven't heard in some form before. I feel I am not alone in this.What is most interesting to me, is that being from a technical background, these are the concepts that I must grasp with daily. The idea that everything will evolve, and the idea of the ""expert"" is a very fluid concept. Being an expert in a particular technology, no longer has the same advantages as it used to. Ideas and technologies are evolving far too quickly, and there is the growing risk of obsolescence.How then, do we take these concepts to other disciplines, and educate with this in mind? What then, is the place of the traditional lecturer, if their practice does not keep up with the world around them? How do we make sure our students are relevant?I believe that the ""90%"" mentioned by David (though provocative, as Jessica Ford has noted), is meant to represent the product of irrelevance."
00:00:57,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","In medicine we are not yet good at educating for what might eventuate -- the human genome wasn't even mapped when I graduated, yet it is forming the basis for diagnosis and targeted treatments in most areas of medicine - no one even conceived this 20 years ago. What I teach is rapidly outdated. We need to have students learn through a curriculum that is forward thinking."
00:01:25,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Whilst inflammatory to say 90% of what we teach doesn't matter, there is some truth. In medicine students spend hours rote learning lists of potential diagnoses related to clinical signs when in reality in clinical practice we order a simple test that tells us the answer - eg learning signs of anaemia vs ordering a blood test and understanding what the anaemia means for that patient."
00:01:36,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","We have to do better - I can't agree more, students through all stages of training in medicine, from undergraduate to postgraduate level will tell you there are problems in the way they learn, they graduate each level unprepared for what faces them in the next stage...or in 20 years."
00:02:09,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Medicine has become so specialised doctors don't think outside their own discipline leading to fragmented care. If we could teach doctors to think beyond the 'surface' problem they are expert in diagnosing and understand the whole person in which the disease manifests patients would receive better care."
----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","Medicine moves rapidly. Curriculums are developed years in advance ensuring  when they implemented they are outdated. Probably not 90% out of date, but by the end of a 30 year career in medicine that may be the case. For a fast moving discipline our teaching is stagnate. Students in early med school what to learn to pass exams, but the closer they get to graduating as interns they want to learn to be a good doctor, and they do this by acquiring enough knowledge to connect the complex inter-related systems of the body. I see this often for the first time when they rotate through geriatric medicine where it dawns on them that one system impacts on another to cause multi-morbidity."
00:00:55,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"Educate for the unknown","I'm from medicine.  There is a core body of knowledge which is required to practice as a doctor upon graduation - while medicine is indeed ever evolving, certain basics evolve very slowly (eg anatomy).  But perhaps this doesn't need to be taught (ie the students can ""self direct"" themselves to this information, but this requires a certain mentality and commitment not ubiquitous amongst students, particularly in the early years). Moving from this, the focus has become ""graduate capabilities"". But perhaps the teachers again are deciding the content.  Is a student in the position to know what is important upon graduation?"
00:01:57,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"understandings of wide scope","Yes.  It is important to develop understandings of wide scope, but perhaps this needs to be developed in conjunction with a rich and full understanding of ones own discipline to be truly useful."
----,"Penelope Uther",comment,student,,"While certainly valid points, the educational program will need to somewhat be developed and evaluated in terms of ones own discipline.  Often the objectives of the course extend far beyond the course content or subject matter.  Learning ""deeply"" about one topic can help a student develop the skill of deep learning.  This skill then needs to be able to be transferrable to other areas, including the unknown."
00:00:57,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Educating for the unknown","This is a very relevant point for Engineering, because no engineer will be asked to solve a problem that has already been solved before - it is our job to educate engineers to be able to apply what they have learnt to solve new and unforeseen problems."
----,"Heba Khamis",comment,student,,"I think the most relevant point for the Engineering discipline is the idea of ""Educating for the Unknown"" - no engineer will be asked to solve a problem that has already been solved before - it is our job to educate engineers to be able to apply what they have learnt to solve new and unforeseen problems. I believe, that to do this we must arm students with all the foundations required to solve these problems. Often times however, we do not effectively communicate to students the reasons for learning these seemingly irrelevant concepts."
00:01:12,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"90% of what we teach is a waste of time","I'm not sure I agree with this. While ""90% of what we teach,...those kids will never encounter in a significant way in their lives"", I don't think that teaching them that 90% is a waste of time. In engineering, this 90% is probably the foundation that they will need to come back to when solving a new problem - they may not need to recall the details, but the ""I remember learning something about xxx"" moment may inspire alternative or ""out of the box"" solutions."
00:01:56,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Understandings of wide scope","In engineering, I believe this what we teach, however, unfortunately, I feel this is not always being effectively communicated to the students - ""why are we learning this"" was a common question I had as an undergraduate when learning about something that was seemingly irrelevant to my discipline."
00:01:02,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,,
00:01:56,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"wide scope of learning",
----,"Gregory Martens",comment,student,,"An interesting point of view. One aspect that surprised me was the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I'm involved with the industrial design program and focus on the manufacturing aspects that a designer needs to know and understand when designing products for mass production. To support the in class technical learning i encourage my students to be aware of their surroundings as they move about their day to day activities. I encourage them to use their inquisitive minds and ask why has something been designed that way? It's about thinking and understanding why."
00:00:50,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I'm from physics and engineering disciplines. The necessary (in particular, basic) subjects in my disciplines are almost fixed, so we need to spend much time on methods. But I agree that we should re-think regularly about advanced subjects and then structure of curriculum."
00:01:25,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"90% seems a little bit exaggeration. (I hope it is not.) It should depend on disciplines, level of both students and lecturers, and many other factors. Anyway, good structures, communications and feedbacks from students would reduce the percentages."
00:02:05,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"Understanding of wide scope is surely important. But I think it's difficult for especially junior students. Understanding of wide scope will be gained through a long study and experiences. We should think about not single course or year but the long term teaching structure for students to gain the understandings of wide scope."
----,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",comment,student,,"I feel that how and what we should teach largely depend on disciplines and levels of students. In my case, I teach undergraduate engineering students. What they must learn are fairly fixed, so I have thought more about methods and structures of courses to encourage them to get deep understandings. But from this video, I realise the importance to think occasionally about educations in wider contexts."
00:00:40,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,"peer review; curriculum design; accountability","This made me think about academic program reviews that use focus groups and evaluations from students about the direction of the course; the importance of peer review and update of course curriculum to ensure its relevance; and considering how what we teach impacts on communities and how we make it accountable. It also made me think about the difference (in value) between learning content vs learning skills."
00:00:50,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,"generational differences","This idea of how we will 'get' 'youngsters' to learn what we think they 'ought' to learn raises interesting generational questions."
00:00:59,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"I love this focus on educating for the unknown, on the future, for nimble ways of thinking, for large understandings - whilst learning from the past - and a looking towards coding the unexpected. This is quite beautiful!"
00:01:06,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"90% of what we teach is a waste of time... Well, he seems to be saying that it is too specific, rather than being a grand,generalised theory. But I think there are benefits to learning the local, which can be applied and compared with broader and future events and problems. I hope that the students learn critical thinking, ability to analyse, and also not to draw too broad a conclusion - to keep specifics (historical specificity, cultural situation, etc) in mind."
00:02:34,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"This is interesting - curriculum is one of the most resistant fronts of education. This resonates when one thinks about critiques of academia as an ivory tower, out of touch with generations and communities, and reluctant to let go of what set knowledge."
----,"Zahra Stardust",comment,student,,"I found this focus on the future, the unknown, and a nimble mind quite beautiful, and agree that curriculum is reluctant to change and is quite possibly stuck in a framework of how we will 'get' 'youngsters' to learn what we think they ought to know. This raised important questions for me generational differences, learning content v learning skills, and about curriculum design, peer review, and community consultation (who does this impact?) and accountability. However I'm not sure that moving towards bigger grander theories is the answer - there is a risk of generalisation. I think there is value in learning about the local and the specific. It allows students to take a critical mind to broader social trends."

----,"Jeremy Henson",comment,student,null,"I think students are smart and wise enough to get it when you are focusing on teaching them what really matters and will respond by being more interested and willing to think more about the subject.Teaching processes not just data will also encourage deep learning, however will need to be careful that students get this as easier to see how data is assessed than the processes.In my area deep learning would be seeing patterns in how cells work and fitting pathways into the big picture and how theylink to other pathways"
00:00:30,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"This is an interesting point: What's worth learning? However, it may not be the best of the ideas to ask this question from students because one needs to have a fair understanding of the entire discipline to be able to decide what is 'worthless' and what is worth learning."
00:00:36,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I fear there is no way to determine what we should learn for the next 30 years. Is there any one person who could have forecast 30 years ago (i.e., in about 1985) what would happen in 30 years' of time? We need to learn for the most immediate future and then continuously educate ourselves to keep pace with the developments in our chosen fields."
00:00:52,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"This is another interesting point. Wwhat is more important: to talk about what we should learn or to talk about how (i.e., using what learning methods) we should learn. I think content is more important than method."
00:01:13,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I find the claim that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time annoying."
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"Although I find the question ""What is worth learning?"" interesting, I strongly disagree with the claim that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. One may forget things (mostly factual information), but the connections and causative relationships should be (and hopefully will be) remembered. The worst case scenario that someone forgets things -- but they are still able to recall where the relevant information should be looked up. Knowing where to look up things is half of the knowledge.All in all, learning is definitely not a waste of time, especially if someone takes the effort to understand the subject. If a student realises this and agrees with it, there is a good chance that they become deep learners."

For certain courses, I'd imagine that transferring 'particular skills and particular nuggets of knowledge' might be necessary at least at the tertiary level."
00:01:55,"Pichamon Yeophantong",annotation,student,Pichamon,"'Understandings of wide scope' -- nice. I absolutely agree with self-reflexivity and a multidisciplinary outlook in teaching and learning."
----,"Pichamon Yeophantong",comment,student,Pichamon,"I very much like the notion of teaching as encouraging 'large understandings' that can help students to 'code the unexpected and the expected'. It also ties in nicely with the importance that was placed on cultivating a multidisciplinary outlook in teaching and learning. I agree that pushing students to go beyond their disciplinary confines and think self-reflexively about what they are learning (and us, about what we're teaching) is crucial to the development of students' critical thinking faculties. At the same time, any discipline that fails to look at itself in a self-reflexive manner and allow for a degree of resilience in curriculum-building could stand the risk of gradually losing their relevance, not to mention appeal."
00:01:17,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"It's hard to know or predict what is worth learning. I do not Agree that 90% of what we teach is not worth learning.If someone has to do a subject because it is part of the curriculum and must do the subject to pass. They may not necessarily take a deep approach to learning the subject,especially if they have no interest in the subject matter being taught.Perhaps courses could be made more flexible so students can choose the subjects they are most interested in."
00:01:00,"Maria Nawaz",annotation,student,,"I find the idea of educating for the unknown very relevant to my work in teaching students in clinical legal education courses.

----,"Maria Nawaz",comment,student,,"I disagree with the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I think in order to address this issue, we need to try and ensure that we engage in different methods of teaching in recognition that students may learn differently."
----,"Melinda Chylinski",comment,student,,"I definitely do not agree that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time.In safety  most of the subjects are based on legislation and regulations. Students need to demonstrate their understanding what is required by the law and hopefully be able to put this into practice to keep themselves and others safe.It is sometimes difficult for me to engage students when they are only doing the course because it is part of their employment conditions or are told they they must undertake the course to do a particular activity and have little or no interest in the subject matter. In saying this I try to develop the content so students can develop a deeper understanding of the subject and hopefully put this into practice in their daily lives.Students should know how to behave safely, identify others who are not behaving safely and be able to resolve any safety issues they have."
00:01:44,"Jaz Lawes",annotation,student,"different approaches required for different disciplines",
----,"Jaz Lawes",comment,student,,"I really enjoy the idea of 'shifting' within current curricula, making it more flexible. Students are increasingly disengaged with traditional teaching strategies with pre-defined learning targets. Such targets are necessary to maintain a logical flow of ideas, but creative and innovative ways to transfer the information are necessary to make certain topics more relevant and relatable. This includes broadening the scope of understanding of a discipline. I like Professor Perkins' point to get students to see how their discipline fits within/alongside/compared with other disciplines - providing a broad 'big picture' approach and wider level of understanding in the end."
00:00:29,"Alex Baumber",annotation,student,,"My immediate thoughts for my course is that what's worth learning are the skills to analyse the information you're provided, seek out new information and question the world you live in - but I'm thinking of Masters students here so I wonder if that's realistic at undergrad level..."

00:02:10,"Alex Baumber",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of wide scope to think about how the discipline looks outside itself. I teach engineering fundamentals to non-engineers (and have previously taught sustainability to engineers) so have seen how perspectives inside and outside a discipline can vary."
----,"Alex Baumber",comment,student,,"I enjoyed hearing his insights. For me, what's worth learning most are the skills to analyse, question and consider how others view the world and what their roles are. With this in mind, I'm not sure that I agree that 90% of what's taught is a waste of time (at least I hope it's not in my classes). Different parts of what is taught will resonate with different students, so even if the majority quickly forget a particular point, it may stimulate an interest or create a ""lightbulb"" moment in other students, so is still worthwhile. I liked his idea of ""wide"" learning, which is another element that I like to promote in my classes, alongside the ""deep"" learning we discussed in the opening session."
00:00:32,"Joe Allen",annotation,student,,"I found the thought of &ldquo;what is worth learning&rdquo; and the process of moving away from &ldquo;narrow deep pieces of knowledge&rdquo; interesting.

00:01:00,"Joe Allen",annotation,student,,"I agree with taking learning away from the narrow deep pieces of knowledge and moving towards understandings of wide scope across disciplines would better ready students to think nimbly and move more fluidly between the career changes they will likely encounter.Given the increasing fluidity of the job market where a job for life is replaced with people moving regularly between companies, industries and disciplines, this idea is particularly relevant."

However, looking at this concept from the perspective of my own area (teaching career preparation) it is hard to see the alternative to teaching deep narrow pieces of knowledge for certain concepts. Over recent years there has been a shift in what companies classify as &amp;amp;lsquo;job ready&amp;amp;rsquo; graduates. Where once, companies sought discipline specific technical expertise they now look to recruit across a broad range of disciplines to fill their organisations needs and prefer to seek skills students possess (i.e. analytical, problem solving and communication skills) rather than knowledge.Feedback from employers indicates that graduates aren't ""job ready"" and this is where I completely agree that curriculum is a resistant front. The world is a rapidly changing environment. The way we teach people about the world needs to reflect this by adapting curriculum and focusing on teaching the skills needed to cope with and respond to this change.Students often want to focus on fixing the immediate issue - how to ""game"" the recruitment process and it is easy to get caught in teaching narrow deep concepts to mastery.

----,"Toni Ferrara",comment,student,"Toni Ferrara Summary","As with many of my fellow FULTsters I was also intrigued and concerned by Professor Perkins comments on how 90% of what we teach is a waste of time and that we should restructure our curriculum to teach students what they need to know for their daily life. No one can say what knowledge is useful and what is not.  I think categorizing knowledge this way and teaching students that only certain ideas have value is dangerous. It is impossible to become proficient in a discipline without understanding basic fundamental concepts. Yes, the way we currently teach these fundamental principles tends to be stale and often tedious but the way forward  is not to abandon teaching these principles but to train students to see how they form the foundation for understanding a bigger picture. I do agree that the way we currently teach has vast room for improvement and that certain changes to the curriculum are critical. I think the challenge is to promote a deep approach to learning so students can appreciate how potentially tedious concepts have relevance to their life.  This video was very short so I think we need more clarification and examples of what Professor Perkins means to fully understand and appreciate his point of view."
00:02:23,"Marcus De Leeuw",annotation,student,curriculum,"In my area - law - there is a big tension between teaching students practical skills they need as future lawyers etc and a more deep theoretical and philosophical understanding of the law. I do not agree that 90% of what we teach is 'waste' - I would rather say that students only have ""space"" for 10% of what we teach them. I think that ""thinking outside the box"" should be a mandatory part of each lecture /assignment but the curriculum demands we teach a particular amount of content which often leaves little room to experiment."

----,"Susanne Schmeidl",comment,student,"Overall Reflection","His view of education very much matches my own. I like the idea to teach HOW to learn, not just facts.  Of course teaching facts is important, but one also needs to teach them how to be able to access facts in the future, how to read and critique them, so when they come across different facts in the future, they know what to do. I like the idea of teaching for students to deal with the unexpected, that very much matches my own philosophy. I also agree that this idea of teaching as learning, and a process that never stops is not often easily fit into an existing curriculum and I have to frankly say I struggle with that in each of my lectures. How much to teach facts, knowledge, and how much how to assess knowledge critically. So I am glad to see I am not the only gabbling with how to reconcile teaching facts and knowledge with teaching how learn and think critical. Both matters, and getting the balance right is important."

How does this case study, these events, this time period have relevance for me in wanting to major in History. Is being a History scholar about acquiring knowledge around these particular points of information. As a tutor and a historian I am certainly trying to encourage students to see the revelancy of different ways of approaching history and historical knowledge, 'deeper' as opposed to 'surface' ways of understanding the past and present through the discourse around particular dates or events for instance."
00:02:08,"Sophie Robinson",annotation,student,null,"I feel that the Humanities is best placed here, in this 'bigger scope' teaching and learning focus, particularly more interdisciplinary courses that rest on the understanding that knowledge requires multiple methods and ways of understanding, different critiques, theories, practices."
----,"Sophie Robinson",comment,student,null,"As a tutor and academic involved with undergraduate History, the key ideas that arose for me are how students connect their knowledge of historical dates, events and time periods with an awareness of the relevancy of this information for themselvess as historical analysts, and in cumulating an awarness of historical analysis as an ongoing methodological issue. A way of doing rather than knowing. This is not easily communicated so early on in the undergrad experience. When I sense deeper learning is happening in the class setting I think I notice more flow in student discourse, particularly between students - who are their co-learners, their peers. The bouncing off and between students, their ideas, an active questioning of their own views and each others. This level of responsiveness suggests a deep level of engagement. Particularly when we're talking in big historical narratives or if we focus on a certain event or historical issue, the material is most deeply interrogated when they then weave micro and macro examples and issues in.Course materials have a lot to do with it - That is, their level of interest as they read the article or chapter, etc, whether they have enjoyed the reading experience necessarily affects their ability to want to discuss it in a class context therefore prompting even more engagement with it. When a student senses that the class as a whole, or a vast majortiy at least, has had a significant connection to the material, this can also help a student reflect deeper about their indidual experience surrounding the material, and the knowledge they have gained from it. It also falls on the tutor, as a guide through often new and challenging material and perspectives, to invite extra and deeper questioning opf individuals and the class as a whole. Namely through prompts such as discussion questions, small group work, activities, etc."

Whats worth learning to me, as an environmental/earth scientist is going to be vastly different to a historian or lawyer, for example. At some basic level we all need a foundation of information - fundamentally, we, the individual have to decided what is worth learning. As teachers, we need to teach our students to think for themselves. They need to be the ones that sort the wheat from the chaff. In terms of the factors that might be contributing to students taking this deep approach - I think when a student can think of themselves as part of the system, that is, the environment of their study; whether is be law, environmental science, medicine - whatever, then they can form a context around which to frame the information they are taking in."

What ways of thinking and what skills can we offer them that will be of use (analytical and learning skills, but also skills that allow them to 'interprete &amp; navigate the unknown' as Prof. Perkins calls it).

Especially traditional courses need to be revisited by asking the question of what's worth learning today rather than what we thought worth learning when the relevant textbooks were initially written. The next step is to think about how can we get the students to learn what we have decided they have to learn?I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Professor Perkins statement about irrelevancy of more than 90% of what we learn. The problem does not lie in what we learn in the traditional system, the problem rather lies in the current weakness of system on teaching the how to apply what we have learn. While many of the general topics such as physics and math may seem irrelevant and may never be used directly by a typical person in his/her life, one should note that they have played a significant role in developing the systematic and logical way of thinking in most of the successful engineers we see today. In other words, those seemingly irrelevant topics are actually case example by themselves on how a problem has to be defined and tackled systematically. This is very much discipline dependent, but it&amp;rsquo;s known that in engineering, the most important skill is the problem solving skill including all its components starting from problem definition. With this, the focus is mainly placed on teaching of methodologies that can be used to cope with unexpected as well as the expected and not methods for or examples of solving a particular problem that for sure one would be dealing with in his/her life. As a leading university, UNSW needs to focus on training  students who are innovate, have the courage to tackle new problems, are not afraid of taking on new challenges and are capable of pushing the boundaries of science and industry.
