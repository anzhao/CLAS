----,"David John Farr",comment,student,"Bit Encoding Video Summary","There was 4 types of base encoding highlighted in the video:(i) Decimal or Base 10 [0...9](ii) Binary or Base 2 [0,1](iii) Octal or Base 8 [0...7](iv) Hexadecimal or Base 16 [0...9,A...F]The methods of translating between bases are as follows:(1) Base 10 -&gt; Base 2: use successive division by the value 2 until you reach 0. The remainders of each step represent each bit of the binary sequence. The first remainder obtained represents the least significant bit and the last is the most significant. The bit sequence goes from high to low significance.(2) Base 2 -&gt; Base 10: each bit corresponds to the increasing power of 2 from right to left (2^0, 2^1, 2^2 etc). Discard the zero values in the binary sequence and then multiply each 1 value with its corresponding power of 2. The sum of these final values will give you the decimal number (base 10).(3) Base 2 -&gt; Base 8: group all the bits in the binary sequence, as a set of 3 bits, moving from right to left. If any bits remained ungrouped in a set of 3 then simply add the required zero's to the left until 3 is achieved. Find the equivalent octal number based on each 3 bit set. Generally a zero is put at the front of an octal number to designate it.(4) Base 2 -&gt; Base 16: Same process as base 8 but instead use sets of 4.  If the equivalent hexadecimal number is greater than 9, use A...F (10...15). Hexadecimal numbers have '0x' as prefix to show what type they are.(5) Base 8 -&gt; Base 2: simply translate each one of the digits in its corresponding 3-bit binary representation.(6) Base 16 -&gt; Base 2: same process as base 8 but use 4 digits (bits) for each hexadecimal number."

----,"Sarah Louise Murphy",comment,student,,"Computing Conversions from different bases to binary notation follows a method of successive divisions. This is where the original number is divided successively by the desired base and the remainder each time becomes the value in the placeholder of that division. E.g.The first remainder is placed in the (2^0) column, the second in the (2^1) column, the third in the (2^2) column and so on until there is no quotient remaining. The same method can be used to convert binary to octal noting that 8=2^3 and is represented by 3 bits. Successive division takes place by removing three bits from the quotient until there are no bits left. The remainders are then converted into numbers between 0 and 7 from their binary notation and placed into their place holder from least significant placeholder (first remainder) to most significant.The reverse conversions take place by expanding each number into a binary number whose total number of bits is the power on the base you are converting from. E.g. hexadecimal = 2^4 which means use 4 bits to represent each hexadecimal digit."
----,"Brendan Allan March",comment,student,,"This video demonstrates how to convert between numerical bases 10, 2, 8, 16, using the 'Successive Divisions' technique.Divide the number by the desired base, note remainder. Repeat for int obtained after division. Finally, string together remainders from last to first to form new, converted number.Also, note that when dividing a binary number by a multiple of 2 (ie: 8 or 16), division is done easily by 'chopping off' the last few digits (3 for base 8, 4 for base 16)."

----,"Brendan Allan March",comment,student,,"This video explains what binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers are (bases 2, 8 and 16, respectively), and how to convert between them and decimal numbers (base 10).A binary number only features two digits: 1 and 0. As each digit in a decimal number represents a power of 10, each digit in binary represents a power of 2. [eg: 110 in binary represents 1*(2^2)+1*(2^1)+0*(2^0) = 4+2+0 = 6 in decimal]Similarly, octal numbers contain the digits 0-7, and hexadecimal numbers have digits 0-F.[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F representing the decimal numbers 0-15]The video describes how to convert from one base to another using a technique called 'Successive Division':Divide the number by the base you want to convert to, and note the remainder. Divide the new whole number obtained by the base again, and note the remainder. Repeat this process until the divisions reach 0. Then string together the remainders from last to first - this forms the new, converted number.Note: When dividing a binary number by a power of 2 (ie: 8 or 16), this can be done by 'chopping off' the last few digits (3 for base 8, 4 for base 16), and writing the chopped off digits in the new base (which will be a single digit). Keep doing this until all significant digits have been 'chopped off', then string together the converted remainders, last to first.Finally, octal numbers are denoted by a leading 0 (eg: 0506), and hexadecimal numbers by a leading '0x' (eg: 0x34A5C).Octal and hexadecimal are used in computing as a form of abbreviation for binary digits - a single octal digit represents 3 binary, and a single hexadecimal represents 4 binary."

----,"MacKenzie Quach",comment,student,,"This video explains the techniques computer use to apply base encoding. There are four types of base encoding: 10, 2 (binary), 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal). Conversion between bases is achieved by methods of successive division and expansion. Successive division is the division of the number by 2 and successively dividing its quotient by 2 where the remainder will be the bit.Each of the bits represent the power of its base 2 (the weight) hence expansion is the summation of the bits with 1s.In converting to octal from binary, the binary is grouped in 3s from the end where the 3 bits are the remainder. To differentiate octal from base 10, a 0 is added in front of the octal. In converting to hexadecimal from binary, the binary is now grouped in 4s from the end where the 4 bits are the remainder. In base 16, you will need 16 digits but however there are only 10 hence A B C D E F will be added to have 16 digits. To differentiate hexadecimals from different bases, a 0x is added in front of the hexadecimal."

Add a prefix of 0x to the beginning.Base 8 to base 2: For each digit except the first 0, determine what three digit binary code equals that digit. Put them together.Base 16 to base 2: Similar to calculating base 8 to base 2, except you are determining the 4 digit binary code for each digit in hexadecimal. Discard the prefix. Where letters pop up (A B C D E F) they each correspond to the next 6 numbers from 9. So A = 10, B = 11 etc etc. Therefore A in binary is 1010 (2 + 8 = 10)"
----,"Roy Dylan Porter",comment,student,,"When working within octal conversions, the highest possible number is 8=2^3. Therefore when converting from binary to digit using octal, we take groups of 3.When working in hex the highest possible number is 16, therefore you work with binary conversion of groups of 4. 2^4=16.This highest number is base 2 is 1, therefore 2^0=1. So you take each invididual bit and find out it's 'weight'To do the actual conversion you can simply go from right to left and figure out the value of each bit according to it's position in the binary string and the base you're working in and add them together, but if you're going from decimal to binary you divide the number by the highest power of the base you're working in and the remainder is the bit that will form the binary representation. Repeat this process until you reach 0, and concatenate the remainders from the last remainder you received to the first remainder you received and that is the binary form of that decimal"

----,"Alan Beresford Davies",comment,student,,"When converting from decimal to binary numbers, keep dividing by 2 until you divide 1 by 2. The remainders from each divide are then written from most to least significant bit (the remainder of the first divide is the least significant bit and the one from the last divide is the most) to form the binary representation.When converting from binary to octal, take every 3 bits from right to left and write their decimal representation. A '0' is placed at the front of the numbers to denote that it is an octal number.The method is the same when converting from binary to hexadecimal except you take every 4 bits. Hexadecimal also uses the numbers 0-9 but then A-F to represent the numbers 10-15 respectively. Hexadecimal numbers are also denoted by '0x' at the beginning of the number."

----,"Siyi Chen",comment,student,,"This video explain that how to transfer between base 10, 2, 8, and 16. The idea is to find the power of 2. Base 2 use 1 and 0, base 8 use digits 0-7 and base 16 use digits 1-9, after 9 use A, B, C etc to present util F, then digit 10."

Convert decimal numbers to binary numbers: by successive division by 22. binary to octal: group binary into 3 bits and add the weights, add prefix 03. binary to hexadecimal: group binary coding into 4 bits and add the weight, next add the prefix 0x"
