00:01:10,"Paul Rogers",annotation,student,,"This annotation is for the point raised at around 1:13.I have previously taught a small online course, on creating portfolio websites for artists.There are two main issues with a course that has a technical component.1. There is always an initial technical barrier that must be addressed.2. The nature of any technology, is that it will change / grow / evolve over time.This means that there needs to be two focusses to pair with this idea. Breaking through the initial technical barrier, and then building transferrable skills and concepts that will grow beyond a course.I think the inevitability of change that goes hand-in-hand with technology pairs quite well with the model that education needs to adopt.Building upon transferrable and evolving skill sets, as well as ways of thinking."
00:01:11,"Paul Rogers",annotation,student,,"This is an interesting perspective, although a sweeping judgement that everything is ""typically poor"", and that anything that is relevant or well constructed is ""atypical"". This may be the case sometimes, but I am very wary to adopt this view myself. This view seems common to a lot of people I have personally met in the ""flipped"", or even ""educational development and design areas"".I do not want this view to continue to be adopted as it is unhelpful, and creates barriers to real change."

----,"Paul Rogers",comment,student,,"There are some very interesting ideas here, but I suppose nothing that I haven't heard in some form before. I feel I am not alone in this.What is most interesting to me, is that being from a technical background, these are the concepts that I must grasp with daily. The idea that everything will evolve, and the idea of the ""expert"" is a very fluid concept. Being an expert in a particular technology, no longer has the same advantages as it used to. Ideas and technologies are evolving far too quickly, and there is the growing risk of obsolescence.How then, do we take these concepts to other disciplines, and educate with this in mind? What then, is the place of the traditional lecturer, if their practice does not keep up with the world around them? How do we make sure our students are relevant?I believe that the ""90%"" mentioned by David (though provocative, as Jessica Ford has noted), is meant to represent the product of irrelevance."
00:01:00,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""Educating for the unknown"". I appreciate Professor Perkins' larger point about providing students with more ""nimble"" ways of thinking and interacting with our world. But in disciplinary subjects like science it often takes a long time to get to the ""unknown"". To get to that point, you have to learn to speak the language of the subject with which you are engaging."
00:02:29,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"I did not fully understand the point being made by the speaker here. Is he implying that we should restructure learning materials around the lives people live? That seems like a very narrow criterion by which to build a curriculum. That said, I agree that many subjects can speak to more than just their own disciplines."
00:00:41,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""What's worth learning?"" I'd love to know how some of our undergraduate students would answer this question!"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"An interesting point of view that raised several important questions. That said, I often it find to difficult to take these kinds of ideas and imagine what that would actually look like in the context of the ""harder"" subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics, and so on. I am hoping that this course will show me the way!"
00:00:36,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Who decides what is worth learning?"
00:01:02,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"In the arts we are already teaching for the unexpected, because our primary focus in on teaching students how to think, not what to think"
----,"Jessica Ford",comment,student,,"I have difficulty with the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I teach film and media studies and in my discipline, we focus on teaching students 'how' to think and not 'what' to think. Any amount of critical evaluation of written, verbal and visual texts that students gain through our courses is immensely valuable. We strongly encourage students to look critically at forms of media that make up their daily lives, such as music videos, social media, advertisements and television. Visual literacy in the contemporary era cannot be considered 'a waste of time'"
00:02:20,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Cultural studies and the arts are interdisciplinary by its very nature"
00:02:37,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,null,"I think it is important to teach fundamental princples to students as it gives them understanding of the topics we are teaching. There are basic princples that students will need to know when working as professional. We can not leave these out altoghether.Perhaps students should be giving more thought into what they want to study and where it will lead them in the future."
----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,PerkinsWash,"Fascinating comment on how curriculum is resistant to change and how teaching should look outside the discipline! The trans-disciplinary approach has been espoused in the past but it now seems that much academia is going back to being merely interdisciplinary? Prof Perkins indicates we should take the broadest scope approach."
00:00:55,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I teach International business, business planning and entrepreneurship, therefore I find the comment 'to teach for the unknown' particularly interesting. we need to equip our students for the workplace and world of tomorrow not today. This forward thinking, anticipating needs and almost forecasting is very important. we need to teach our students to adapt to a dynamic environment, to be 'street smart' and to think creatively out of the box."
00:02:29,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I find the comment about curriculum design also very interesting since we cannot teach students to connect the dots between different courses and subject matter if the programs and products we offer is inflexible and narrowly put together. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research needs to feed through to teaching as well. How to achieve this, however is another question."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,,"I found this a very interesting conversation. I will take away the following ideas: We need to prepare students for the unknown by including tools from different disciplines. This will enable them to draw on a wide knowledge base and utilise these tools in creative ways. Students also need to take responsibility of their personal learning journey."
00:01:13,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of what&rsquo;s worth learning. In science, technology is advancing quite rapidly. This means that the teaching focus should be changed to match these developments. Having said that, I don&rsquo;t think 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. In many disciplines you need to have an understanding of basic concepts before you can really do much."
00:00:57,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","In medicine we are not yet good at educating for what might eventuate -- the human genome wasn't even mapped when I graduated, yet it is forming the basis for diagnosis and targeted treatments in most areas of medicine - no one even conceived this 20 years ago. What I teach is rapidly outdated. We need to have students learn through a curriculum that is forward thinking."
00:01:25,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Whilst inflammatory to say 90% of what we teach doesn't matter, there is some truth. In medicine students spend hours rote learning lists of potential diagnoses related to clinical signs when in reality in clinical practice we order a simple test that tells us the answer - eg learning signs of anaemia vs ordering a blood test and understanding what the anaemia means for that patient."
00:01:36,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","We have to do better - I can't agree more, students through all stages of training in medicine, from undergraduate to postgraduate level will tell you there are problems in the way they learn, they graduate each level unprepared for what faces them in the next stage...or in 20 years."
00:02:09,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Medicine has become so specialised doctors don't think outside their own discipline leading to fragmented care. If we could teach doctors to think beyond the 'surface' problem they are expert in diagnosing and understand the whole person in which the disease manifests patients would receive better care."
----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","Medicine moves rapidly. Curriculums are developed years in advance ensuring  when they implemented they are outdated. Probably not 90% out of date, but by the end of a 30 year career in medicine that may be the case. For a fast moving discipline our teaching is stagnate. Students in early med school what to learn to pass exams, but the closer they get to graduating as interns they want to learn to be a good doctor, and they do this by acquiring enough knowledge to connect the complex inter-related systems of the body. I see this often for the first time when they rotate through geriatric medicine where it dawns on them that one system impacts on another to cause multi-morbidity."
00:00:55,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"Educate for the unknown","I'm from medicine.  There is a core body of knowledge which is required to practice as a doctor upon graduation - while medicine is indeed ever evolving, certain basics evolve very slowly (eg anatomy).  But perhaps this doesn't need to be taught (ie the students can ""self direct"" themselves to this information, but this requires a certain mentality and commitment not ubiquitous amongst students, particularly in the early years). Moving from this, the focus has become ""graduate capabilities"". But perhaps the teachers again are deciding the content.  Is a student in the position to know what is important upon graduation?"
00:01:57,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"understandings of wide scope","Yes.  It is important to develop understandings of wide scope, but perhaps this needs to be developed in conjunction with a rich and full understanding of ones own discipline to be truly useful."
----,"Penelope Uther",comment,student,,"While certainly valid points, the educational program will need to somewhat be developed and evaluated in terms of ones own discipline.  Often the objectives of the course extend far beyond the course content or subject matter.  Learning ""deeply"" about one topic can help a student develop the skill of deep learning.  This skill then needs to be able to be transferrable to other areas, including the unknown."
00:00:57,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Educating for the unknown","This is a very relevant point for Engineering, because no engineer will be asked to solve a problem that has already been solved before - it is our job to educate engineers to be able to apply what they have learnt to solve new and unforeseen problems."
----,"Heba Khamis",comment,student,,"I think the most relevant point for the Engineering discipline is the idea of ""Educating for the Unknown"" - no engineer will be asked to solve a problem that has already been solved before - it is our job to educate engineers to be able to apply what they have learnt to solve new and unforeseen problems. I believe, that to do this we must arm students with all the foundations required to solve these problems. Often times however, we do not effectively communicate to students the reasons for learning these seemingly irrelevant concepts."
00:01:12,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"90% of what we teach is a waste of time","I'm not sure I agree with this. While ""90% of what we teach,...those kids will never encounter in a significant way in their lives"", I don't think that teaching them that 90% is a waste of time. In engineering, this 90% is probably the foundation that they will need to come back to when solving a new problem - they may not need to recall the details, but the ""I remember learning something about xxx"" moment may inspire alternative or ""out of the box"" solutions."
00:01:56,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Understandings of wide scope","In engineering, I believe this what we teach, however, unfortunately, I feel this is not always being effectively communicated to the students - ""why are we learning this"" was a common question I had as an undergraduate when learning about something that was seemingly irrelevant to my discipline."

00:01:56,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"wide scope of learning",
----,"Gregory Martens",comment,student,,"An interesting point of view. One aspect that surprised me was the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I'm involved with the industrial design program and focus on the manufacturing aspects that a designer needs to know and understand when designing products for mass production. To support the in class technical learning i encourage my students to be aware of their surroundings as they move about their day to day activities. I encourage them to use their inquisitive minds and ask why has something been designed that way? It's about thinking and understanding why."
00:00:50,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I'm from physics and engineering disciplines. The necessary (in particular, basic) subjects in my disciplines are almost fixed, so we need to spend much time on methods. But I agree that we should re-think regularly about advanced subjects and then structure of curriculum."
00:01:25,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"90% seems a little bit exaggeration. (I hope it is not.) It should depend on disciplines, level of both students and lecturers, and many other factors. Anyway, good structures, communications and feedbacks from students would reduce the percentages."
00:02:05,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"Understanding of wide scope is surely important. But I think it's difficult for especially junior students. Understanding of wide scope will be gained through a long study and experiences. We should think about not single course or year but the long term teaching structure for students to gain the understandings of wide scope."
----,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",comment,student,,"I feel that how and what we should teach largely depend on disciplines and levels of students. In my case, I teach undergraduate engineering students. What they must learn are fairly fixed, so I have thought more about methods and structures of courses to encourage them to get deep understandings. But from this video, I realise the importance to think occasionally about educations in wider contexts."
00:00:40,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,"peer review; curriculum design; accountability","This made me think about academic program reviews that use focus groups and evaluations from students about the direction of the course; the importance of peer review and update of course curriculum to ensure its relevance; and considering how what we teach impacts on communities and how we make it accountable. It also made me think about the difference (in value) between learning content vs learning skills."
00:00:50,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,"generational differences","This idea of how we will 'get' 'youngsters' to learn what we think they 'ought' to learn raises interesting generational questions."
00:00:59,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"I love this focus on educating for the unknown, on the future, for nimble ways of thinking, for large understandings - whilst learning from the past - and a looking towards coding the unexpected. This is quite beautiful!"
00:01:06,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"90% of what we teach is a waste of time... Well, he seems to be saying that it is too specific, rather than being a grand,generalised theory. But I think there are benefits to learning the local, which can be applied and compared with broader and future events and problems. I hope that the students learn critical thinking, ability to analyse, and also not to draw too broad a conclusion - to keep specifics (historical specificity, cultural situation, etc) in mind."
00:02:34,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"This is interesting - curriculum is one of the most resistant fronts of education. This resonates when one thinks about critiques of academia as an ivory tower, out of touch with generations and communities, and reluctant to let go of what set knowledge."
----,"Zahra Stardust",comment,student,,"I found this focus on the future, the unknown, and a nimble mind quite beautiful, and agree that curriculum is reluctant to change and is quite possibly stuck in a framework of how we will 'get' 'youngsters' to learn what we think they ought to know. This raised important questions for me generational differences, learning content v learning skills, and about curriculum design, peer review, and community consultation (who does this impact?) and accountability. However I'm not sure that moving towards bigger grander theories is the answer - there is a risk of generalisation. I think there is value in learning about the local and the specific. It allows students to take a critical mind to broader social trends."

00:01:23,"Jeremy Henson",annotation,student,null,"yes but need to cover what might be needed by all even though may not be a lot of overlap between individuals"
----,"Jeremy Henson",comment,student,null,"I think students are smart and wise enough to get it when you are focusing on teaching them what really matters and will respond by being more interested and willing to think more about the subject.Teaching processes not just data will also encourage deep learning, however will need to be careful that students get this as easier to see how data is assessed than the processes.In my area deep learning would be seeing patterns in how cells work and fitting pathways into the big picture and how theylink to other pathways"
