00:01:00,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""Educating for the unknown"". I appreciate Professor Perkins' larger point about providing students with more ""nimble"" ways of thinking and interacting with our world. But in disciplinary subjects like science it often takes a long time to get to the ""unknown"". To get to that point, you have to learn to speak the language of the subject with which you are engaging."
00:02:29,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"I did not fully understand the point being made by the speaker here. Is he implying that we should restructure learning materials around the lives people live? That seems like a very narrow criterion by which to build a curriculum. That said, I agree that many subjects can speak to more than just their own disciplines."
00:00:41,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""What's worth learning?"" I'd love to know how some of our undergraduate students would answer this question!"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"An interesting point of view that raised several important questions. That said, I often it find to difficult to take these kinds of ideas and imagine what that would actually look like in the context of the ""harder"" subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics, and so on. I am hoping that this course will show me the way!"
00:00:36,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Who decides what is worth learning?"
00:01:02,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"In the arts we are already teaching for the unexpected, because our primary focus in on teaching students how to think, not what to think"
----,"Jessica Ford",comment,student,,"I have difficulty with the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I teach film and media studies and in my discipline, we focus on teaching students 'how' to think and not 'what' to think. Any amount of critical evaluation of written, verbal and visual texts that students gain through our courses is immensely valuable. We strongly encourage students to look critically at forms of media that make up their daily lives, such as music videos, social media, advertisements and television. Visual literacy in the contemporary era cannot be considered 'a waste of time'"
00:02:20,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Cultural studies and the arts are interdisciplinary by its very nature"
00:02:37,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,null,"I think it is important to teach fundamental princples to students as it gives them understanding of the topics we are teaching. There are basic princples that students will need to know when working as professional. We can not leave these out altoghether.Perhaps students should be giving more thought into what they want to study and where it will lead them in the future."
----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,PerkinsWash,"Fascinating comment on how curriculum is resistant to change and how teaching should look outside the discipline! The trans-disciplinary approach has been espoused in the past but it now seems that much academia is going back to being merely interdisciplinary? Prof Perkins indicates we should take the broadest scope approach."
00:00:55,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I teach International business, business planning and entrepreneurship, therefore I find the comment 'to teach for the unknown' particularly interesting. we need to equip our students for the workplace and world of tomorrow not today. This forward thinking, anticipating needs and almost forecasting is very important. we need to teach our students to adapt to a dynamic environment, to be 'street smart' and to think creatively out of the box."
00:02:29,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I find the comment about curriculum design also very interesting since we cannot teach students to connect the dots between different courses and subject matter if the programs and products we offer is inflexible and narrowly put together. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research needs to feed through to teaching as well. How to achieve this, however is another question."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,,"I found this a very interesting conversation. I will take away the following ideas: We need to prepare students for the unknown by including tools from different disciplines. This will enable them to draw on a wide knowledge base and utilise these tools in creative ways. Students also need to take responsibility of their personal learning journey."
00:01:13,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of what&rsquo;s worth learning. In science, technology is advancing quite rapidly. This means that the teaching focus should be changed to match these developments. Having said that, I don&rsquo;t think 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. In many disciplines you need to have an understanding of basic concepts before you can really do much."
00:01:10,"Paul Rogers",annotation,student,,"This annotation is for the point raised at around 1:13.I have previously taught a small online course, on creating portfolio websites for artists.There are two main issues with a course that has a technical component.1. There is always an initial technical barrier that must be addressed.2. The nature of any technology, is that it will change / grow / evolve over time.This means that there needs to be two focusses to pair with this idea. Breaking through the initial technical barrier, and then building transferrable skills and concepts that will grow beyond a course.I think the inevitability of change that goes hand-in-hand with technology pairs quite well with the model that education needs to adopt.Building upon transferrable and evolving skill sets, as well as ways of thinking."
00:01:11,"Paul Rogers",annotation,student,,"This is an interesting perspective, although a sweeping judgement that everything is ""typically poor"", and that anything that is relevant or well constructed is ""atypical"". This may be the case sometimes, but I am very wary to adopt this view myself. This view seems common to a lot of people I have personally met in the ""flipped"", or even ""educational development and design areas"".I do not want this view to continue to be adopted as it is unhelpful, and creates barriers to real change."

----,"Paul Rogers",comment,student,,"There are some very interesting ideas here, but I suppose nothing that I haven't heard in some form before. I feel I am not alone in this.What is most interesting to me, is that being from a technical background, these are the concepts that I must grasp with daily. The idea that everything will evolve, and the idea of the ""expert"" is a very fluid concept. Being an expert in a particular technology, no longer has the same advantages as it used to. Ideas and technologies are evolving far too quickly, and there is the growing risk of obsolescence.How then, do we take these concepts to other disciplines, and educate with this in mind? What then, is the place of the traditional lecturer, if their practice does not keep up with the world around them? How do we make sure our students are relevant?I believe that the ""90%"" mentioned by David (though provocative, as Jessica Ford has noted), is meant to represent the product of irrelevance."
