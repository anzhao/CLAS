00:00:16,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I really like this teaching philosophy - I too aim to engage students with teaching content not only to progress successfully through their degree but also to inform their ways of thinking about and engaging with their social worlds"
00:01:06,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Really interesting to hear this view on 'engagement and passion' as a quality to aspire to in teaching - yes, students may enjoy this, but is it really the essential ingredient of successful learning? Or is that much more based on careful preparation, understanding how students learn and designing learning activities in a way that will really get students immersed?"
00:01:43,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"This will work well in smaller group teaching, but could it work in a lecture with 200 students? I'm keen to think about it, as students are currently unimpressed with the lack of participation in lectures!"
00:01:58,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"In teaching research methods, I could imagine simulation exercises which asked students to role play as research teams, to brainstorm research ideas addressing current issues (which could be set for them), and to come up with plans for research that required them to really put themselves in the shoes of the researchers. They could also pretend to be research subjects, funders, communities etc - clearly, this idea is resonating with me!"
00:02:34,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I like the idea that not only do these kind of exercises help students to apply theory to practice, but they make the content area incredibly interesting to students, engaging them in new ways"
00:03:00,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Yes, indeed: 'some students are not going to like it'. But we have to have the courage to try new things, and risk it falling over..."
00:03:15,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"A fabulous synopsis of good teaching - 'a balance between confidence and humility'"
00:03:37,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"It's so important to always recognise that teaching students is a privilege, and that we are continuously learning through that process. Thanks for this video!"
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"This video inspires us to be better teachers by taking responsibility for designing course delivery methods that respond to student learning styles and preferences, and to be courageous in doing so! Seeking to achieve a level of confidence in the approach that is based upon how well it has been considered, but also always being open to improvement. Using simulations as a student learning exercise has lots of potential in my area!"
