00:01:02,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"In the arts we are already teaching for the unexpected, because our primary focus in on teaching students how to think, not what to think"
----,"Jessica Ford",comment,student,,"I have difficulty with the idea that 90% of what we teach is a waste of time. I teach film and media studies and in my discipline, we focus on teaching students 'how' to think and not 'what' to think. Any amount of critical evaluation of written, verbal and visual texts that students gain through our courses is immensely valuable. We strongly encourage students to look critically at forms of media that make up their daily lives, such as music videos, social media, advertisements and television. Visual literacy in the contemporary era cannot be considered 'a waste of time'"

00:01:00,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""Educating for the unknown"". I appreciate Professor Perkins' larger point about providing students with more ""nimble"" ways of thinking and interacting with our world. But in disciplinary subjects like science it often takes a long time to get to the ""unknown"". To get to that point, you have to learn to speak the language of the subject with which you are engaging."
00:02:29,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"I did not fully understand the point being made by the speaker here. Is he implying that we should restructure learning materials around the lives people live? That seems like a very narrow criterion by which to build a curriculum. That said, I agree that many subjects can speak to more than just their own disciplines."
00:00:41,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,,"""What's worth learning?"" I'd love to know how some of our undergraduate students would answer this question!"
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"An interesting point of view that raised several important questions. That said, I often it find to difficult to take these kinds of ideas and imagine what that would actually look like in the context of the ""harder"" subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics, and so on. I am hoping that this course will show me the way!"
