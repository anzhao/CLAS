----,"Sue Williamson",comment,student,"'Coding the unexpected'","Perkins makes some good points, including how we need to teach for 'wide scope', so areas will be relevant for 20, 30 years. He argues there is too much focus on methods and curriculum and not enough on teaching broadly. These points resonate with me as the best lecturer I ever had introduced the subject by saying he was going to teach us how to understand the area and how to navigate through the subject matter, rather than focusing strictly on content. In this way we could teach ourselves forever. I also agree with Perkin's statements about disciplines - my area crosses over several disciplines and I'll think more about these linkages and how I might weave them together more coherently."
00:02:22,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"relevance of what we teach to real life","I agree with the idea that traditional subjects such as literature, history and science can offer valuable insights into real-life. This was one of the points that came up in our group discussion as a ""good learning experience"", if it had relevance to real-life. We as teachers have to ensure we are educating/designing curriculum in this way."

But if I think about my next lecture, then maybe the best I can hope for is that students retain 10% of it, in some form or another depending on what's relevant to them. I think this does come back to what we teach having relevance to real-life and to the future."
----,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",comment,student,,"Perkins says essentially that because we don't know what will happen in the future, we have to teach our students in such a way that they will be able to cope/adapt with what might come up. This is through deep learning, through teaching for ""large understandings that can help us code the unexpected"". For me, this has provoked me to think about what I'm teaching in my next lecture and the way I teach it."
00:00:30,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"what's worth learning","From the perspective of an educational designer my immediate reaction was - ""what is worth ME learning?"" and ""what is worth the people I am teaching/working with learning?"""
00:01:05,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"coding the unexpected","During the week I was talking to a course coordinator about the difficulties of trying to teach so much content during tutorials. I think the flipped classroom and other strategies that demand student input help students to solve unexpected problems, but how can you do it effectively when the prevailing trend each year is to teach more. In some ways, I feel that there is a perception among some that by teaching less in order to engage more with the students at a higher level is seen as compromising on teaching of content."
00:02:08,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"looking outside itself","Why do I need to learn this? I'll never need this in the real world? - providing a context for learning seems like an obvious thing to do. Pin the content to real situations. As a student this almost never happened, but I am almost certain the lecturers and tutors were thinking that was what they were doing. As a tutor and an Ed Designer I always tried to link it back to something relevant, but how effective was I?"
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,"paradigm shift","From the video I get the feeling that there is a paradigm shift in the way we are thinking about teaching. As the world becomes more mobile, we as educators must also become adaptable and move away from a  one size fits all mentality. I've often heard from colleagues, ""I simply don't have time to to teach things the way I want to, so I am just going to do it the way I did last session."" However, this is the first time I've really heard someone challenge the current dogma by almost reassuring the viewer that it is ok to take a surface approach to basic concepts in order to reach a deeper and wider level of understanding that encompasses a range of disciplines and not just your specialty. This video has challenged me to think about ""why"" something is important to know and ""what"" is the best way to teach it."
00:00:54,"Sara Shirowzhan",annotation,student,,"Perkin's idea for future teaching is interesting when he says ""teaching for educating for unknowns, large understanding that can help us code the unexpected as well as the expected"". I think this idea is similar to what we do in research."
00:01:55,"Sara Shirowzhan",annotation,student,"understanding wide scope","I'm wondering about this part of his talk  ""We need to teach content looking for what you might call understanding of wide scope not the narrow deep pieces of knowledge"", is it something like preparing proposals when we read broadly and after that we work in depth?"
00:01:08,"Angela Nickerson",annotation,student,,"I think that ""educating for the unknown"" is an interesting idea. This suggests that we need to focus on helping students to be able to respond to unexpected challenges that may arise in their discipline. It is very different to rote-learning factual information that they may require."
00:01:36,"Angela Nickerson",annotation,student,,"The idea that the ""nuggets of knowledge"" that students learn may be useless to them in the future represents a new way of thinking about teaching. It seems to reduce the emphasis on the provision of information in teaching."

----,"Angela Nickerson",comment,student,,"I thought that this video offered an interesting perspective on teaching - by suggesting that traditional methods of teaching involving imparting many specific pieces of information may not be relevant anymore. The ideas that we need to (1) work with students to help them be able to adapt to challenges in their discipline, and (2) look across disciplines to broaden the scope of teaching area appealing to me."

----,"Patricia Arthur",comment,student,,"My main reaction to this, in light of what we learnt the other day, is that we need to be aware of what parts of the curriculum are successfully taught and assessed at a surface level and what can be explored at a deeper level. ie Our challenge is to successfully recognise this and be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water!!"
----,"Leila Iranmanesh",comment,student,,"Teaching towards flexibility and coping should be taken into account in designing curricula in order to prepare people to encounter known or unknown upcoming situations. However, the question to be raised here is, whether in the speaker's  response there is also emphasis on another important aspect of education which, I believe, is going beyond mere coping. This can be achieved by leaving room for human being's thinking and feeling as well as for their criticality and reflectivity. This accordingly leads to educating people to explore whether these situations are just, ethical and relevant and to act upon them competently or change them if it would be necessary. Consequently, one of the important aspects of education is also giving insights into these changes rather than just planning to be in accordance with known or unknown situations or to cope with them. Second, although considering the ""content"" and the ""wide scopes""; can broaden the views and are valuable to be considered and taught, this consideration does not devalue the importance of methodology. We need to think about them; content and methods, as a spectrum. Thinking dichotomously would be leading to the limiting consequences like when the only focus would be on the methods. Finally, the speaker's claim ; ""90% of what..."" and the percentage ""90%""in particular require  evidence to be considered as an effective argument for further evaluation and analysis."
00:01:25,"Robert Walsh",annotation,student,"90% of what we teach is a waste of time","Need to keep revisiting the question ""how do we make our efforts as educators count most effectively""?"
----,"Robert Walsh",comment,student,,"In asking what is worth learning now and in the decades to come, Perkins brings up some interesting thoughts. Foremost of which is ""how do we make our efforts as teachers count most effectively""? It would be sad to think that 90% of our efforts are wasted as he suggests may currently be the case.Considering our student's broad range of futures and the extremely rapid pace of change, it is unsurprising that much of what is taught is not directly useful to them when the focus is on narrow highly specialised learning. It makes sense to look for ways to teach and learn that are, as much as possible, future proof. An approach which is based on guiding principles, is adaptive and which provides an emphasis on context over narrow depth certainly appeals.Perkins suggests that overcoming entrenched methods of the curriculum present a substantial challenge. Certainly can see this would be true if people do not buy into this way of thinking."
00:01:57,"Robert Walsh",annotation,student,"understandings of wide scope","Like this! So many of the challenges that are faced in the world today do not fit neatly into a narrow box of one speciality or another."
00:01:28,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,matter,"That's what education is about....it isn't about regurgitating or even using what happened in the past...it's about thinking nimbly and being adaptable to the scenario at hand, especially in the fast changing 21C."
00:00:01,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,,"The discussion accentuating what's worth learning over method discounts the realities of tertiary education which revolve around systems, curricula and the sausage machine of getting students their piece of paper...oooh aren't I a cynic?"
00:02:15,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"broad scope","I'm not sure that you can engage a discipline on the broad scope advocated without the very deep fundamental knowledge taught today underpinning it."
----,"Tom Kramer",comment,student,,"In principle, I agree that a curriculum is the most resistant front to adaptable and nimble learning. However, the reality is that the education system needs to administer consistent standards across disparate institutions. So nice advocacy by The Proff but it's all just nirvana."
00:00:43,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Interesting to hear Professor Perkins stress the question 'what's worth learning', as this is something I've thought about quite a lot as I commence my first experiences of teaching. My area of interest in social research education, so I've really been thinking about what's worth learning about social research for young people embarking on a university education today with aims to contribute usefully to society?"
00:01:35,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"A major concern for me in embarking upon the teaching of social research methods compared with doing it myself is how we make it about influencing students to take on new ways of thinking about and conceptualising possible responses to complex social issues in contemporary life. So I really like his turn away from teaching being about the delivery of specific content areas, and a turn towards building attributes and capacities which will be responsive and flexible and integrated?"
00:02:04,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"As an interdisciplinary researcher, this is music to my ears! I suffer with a continual anxiety that I'm not embedded enough in a particular discipline area, and that I therefore don't go 'deep' enough into particular content areas, but instead focus on connections across areas of mutual concern - for me across the biomedical and social sciences - in responding to contemporary public health issues. I am very excited to think that my approach to teaching can not only fit with this preference of my own research practices, but might actually be of benefit to students..."
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"Wow, I found this incredibly useful and inspiring! It provided me with an immediate connection between my own areas of research interest (spanning disciplinary boundaries in order to address broad and complex social and health issues) and possible ways of articulating my (emerging) approach to learning and teaching. I feel excited to think that my instincts regarding research practice may articulate productively with those operating at the cutting edge of educational theory and practice, and I'm now keen to learn more..."
00:01:12,"Matthew Woolley",annotation,student,,"""90% of what we typically teach is a waste of time"". I think university teachers already understand that subject-specific knowledge is only one component of what a university education is about, the main task being to teach students how to solve complex problems. I think, however, it is very difficult to make students understand this, particularly with the emphasis on detailed course outlines, assignments, exams etc"
----,"Matthew Woolley",comment,student,,"General comment is pretty much the same as my annotation here. I think it is widely understood on the teacher side that a university education should be about how to solve complex problems. Subject-specific knowledge provides the basis for posing the problems in the first place, as well as guidance for how one can solve complex problems. I think this is already represented in curricula, particularly in the presence of large-scale project work in the later years of most degrees."
----,"Jelena Rnjak-Kovacina",comment,student,,"Perkins makes a number of interesting points about current teaching approaches (focusing on the teaching method, rather than &lsquo;what is worth learning&rsquo;), with particular emphasis on the fact that we are not teaching students how to view the discipline as a whole, be critical of it and adapt. I agree that these are important points, especially as I work and teach in a highly multidisciplinary field (biomedical engineering), but I do question:1.	How do we apply this practically- how do we actually design our curriculum to address his points2.	Is it actually possible for students to view any field holistically and critically without understanding its details and intricacies? Experts in any discipline tend to agree that they have not started viewing their field critically until many years into their career (maybe they are a product of their education).  While we should be teaching students to think critically, problem-solve, be motivated by curiosity, know where to search for information, they still need to be taught many details and finer points of the discipline in order to be able to do this."
00:00:56,"Caroline Wake",annotation,student,,"Educating for the unknown ... One can't help but think of Donald Rumsfeld's distinction between ""known unknowns"" (things we know we don't know) and ""unknown unknowns"" (things we don't know we don't know). I've expanded on this in the general comments section."
00:02:37,"Caroline Wake",annotation,student,,"Curriculum is one of the most resistant fronts. Well, (a) this made me laugh because it makes it sounds like a war is going on in the university and (b) it doesn't necessarily have to be the most ""resistant fronts."" Part of the reason that curricula are slow to evolve is that the bureaucracy surrounding them is immense. Often there is a two-year lead time or more to change a subject, let alone a major, program or degree. Perhaps ""conservative"" rather than ""resistant"" would be a better term here."
----,"Caroline Wake",comment,student,,"Educating for the unknown, one can't help but think of the ""known unknowns"" (things we know we don't know) and ""unknown unknowns"" (things we don't know we don't know). I think that tertiary education is actually pretty good at training students how to identify, investigate and address ""known unknowns,"" e.g. ""gaps"" in the literature, the feminist history of this particular war etc. To educate for the ""unknown unknowns"" is a much more complex proposition and can probably--paradoxically--only ever be taught via what are now ""known knowns."" That is to say, we can look to history to learn how discoveries and advances were made and how people responded at the time. For example, this piece of art was so confronting and confounding at the time, ie so outside the realms of the known, that the critics panned it. Or here is a stomach ulcer, this what we thought we had to identify but in fact this bacterium was what we were looking for. To teach for the unknown unknowns would be to teach for imagination, courage and conviction, and it's a good ideal to aim for, but like the other commenters I wonder where this leaves me when faced with X number of faces on Day 1 of Week 1 (ie today!)."
00:01:14,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,waste,"I've often reflected on how little content I actually recall from all my studies over numerous courses covering many years. All that remains now are the graduate capabilities that I developed, though at the time I wasn't conscious of them and they were never articulated to me. Hence I agree that 90% of what is taught is a waste of time."
00:02:08,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,wide,"In my experience it is very challenging for most teachers to give up their precious content. I can really relate to that myself. I am tempted to cram in as much as possible in the workshop time available."
00:00:58,"Niki Fardouly",annotation,student,unknown,"I like that idea of educating for the unknown. Being able to cope in an unexpected future situation where there are no straight forward answers or predetermined paths to follow. Wouldn't that be the perfect graduate? Someone who can think on their feet, be analytical, think critically, apply their prior experience to new situations and create something new?"
----,"Niki Fardouly",comment,student,"unknown knowledge","Perkins is making a very challenging statement about learning and teaching. If we teach only for broad understanding and to develop graduate capabilities, then what about the narrow deep knowledge that is required as the foundational understanding of the discipline? Yet when I reflect on my own experience of education I recognise that there is  little content that I can recall today. Mostly I have just retained the general graduate capabilities. How to create the perfect balance between core deep knowledge and broad future-proof understanding?"

00:02:44,"Juan Pablo Escobedo-Diaz",annotation,student,,"I liked the video: short and right to the point!. My general comment is similar to my annotations: I totally agree with the overall idea that we need to teach with the premise of preparing the students to think for themselves so they can face new problems later in their life. And those ""real"" problems will most likely require a comprehensive set of skills/knowledge."
----,"Juan Pablo Escobedo-Diaz",comment,student,,"Trying again as I don't see my comment :).As before, I liked the video. And I agree with most of the comments made by David: we need to teach with the idea of giving the students a ""useful"" comprehensive preparation."
----,"Stephen Doherty",comment,student,,"His question of 'what is worth learning' is refreshing. I think there is a huge push towards practical skills to perform a specific job role (which may be redundant in time anyway) which is driven by the job market. Some skills and knowledge are valuable for the sake of personal and professional development and can be transferred to many different jobs, both present and future, e.g., analytical skills."

Students need to have understandings of a wide scope. In the context of media and communications discipline, it is especially relevant. The landscape of media and communications is a fast moving one. Who knows what happens to Facebook and Twitter tomorrow?  That however does not necessarily mean what student learn today are irrelevant for tomorrow. Contextual knowledge is important as it helps students to connect the dots and understand the bigger picture. Having said that, I believe small nugget of knowledge will help students to have a good understanding of the big picture as the context changes."

00:01:19,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"Like others, I'd like to know where the 90% figure comes from. To me, it would depend on what you are teaching. Newtonian physics is not likely to change much but it's a useful exercise and teaches students to think in a certain way. Just because it has/will be superseded does not make it a waste of time. How would you even measure this? How to you differentiate what has shaped the student as a person or thinker verses what knowledge they may or may not be using at a given time?"

----,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",comment,student,"Improving the curriculum","The premise is that it is important to teach for the known and the unknown. I agree with this.It then suggests that 90% of what is currently taught is a waste of time because they are narrow deep pieces of knowledge - doesn't the understanding of the fundamentals of any field require large amounts of deep knowledge? These fundamentals would be critical for dealing with the unknown I think. Or is the argument for replacing the 90% with better in depth coverage of topics?"

----,"Isobelle Barrett Meyering",comment,student,,"I agree that we should think critically about what we teach students and whether it really matters.However, I'm not sure I see questions of content (what we teach) and method (how we teach) as so distinct. For example, if part of our thinking about the method of teaching is about how we best get students to ask critical questions themselves - then I say that in itself as a useful outcome and one which is about engaging with the wide scope."
00:00:50,"Forrest Duxbury",annotation,student,,"I agree that this applies to some if not many courses to a certain extent. But learning previously valuable knowledge that is now considered unappliable in the future, is definitely valuable when used for the right reasons. As others have noted, certain historical ideas are still at the core of teaching topics as they help impart the skills required to mentally process/engage with future appliable ideas."
00:02:08,"Forrest Duxbury",annotation,student,,"I agree with this. Sometimes deep knowledge was originally gained for a very specific purpose, and is still valuable for others who also need that purpose, but not for the majority who would be better served being able to access a effective resource that has this knowledge when needed (eg. Website, Book). Perhaps more needs to be shuffled out of the core courses in a program, and into the elective/major courses for a program."
00:01:11,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"""90% of what we teach is a waste of time"" - it is if we make up random statistics. I think teaching can be more efficient and effective - but I think when we try to quantify teaching element between a simple dichotomy of 'useful' and 'useless' materials it is problematic."
----,"Paul Munro",comment,student,,"I found his 90% comment to be a bit baseless. I think we can say that, broadly, we need to 'think outside the box' to promote better learning experience for our students. But I don't think this is reached by trying to quantify what is useful and what isn't in our current approaches. I think it is deeper and more complex than that"
00:02:15,"Leonie Ligertwood",annotation,student,,"I think disciplinary thinking is often the result of the outcomes expected in professions.  I don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with that.  However, it is valid that students need to learn about different ways of viewing the world, and different ways of thinking.

00:00:55,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,,"Educating for the unknown is an evocative phrase, and is something I think should be part of any course design, but it's not enough on its own, is it?

00:02:15,"Laura Crommelin",annotation,student,,"I really appreciate his point about the value of interdisciplinarity - this is something I try to draw on in how I design my course materials, and I think it's a really useful way of opening students up to different perspectives as well as forcing them to put their discipline in a broader context."
----,"Laura Crommelin",comment,student,,"The point of this video clearly seems to be to provoke a debate as much as set out an actual plan for education strategy - some of the statements seem a little hyperbolic, but I think the underlying arguments are good. There obviously will need to be variations to how this kind of approach is applied in different disciplines - doctors need to know a lot of 'facts', for example - and students also appreciate concepts being grounded in facts and figures sometimes. But overall the general shift in thinking proposed seems valuable. I particularly appreciated the points made about the value of inter-disciplinarity - I use material from a range of disciplines in my courses and it's always a great way of opening the students' eyes to new ideas and giving them an understanding of the broader relevance of their subject matter."
00:02:44,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"Provocative but also ironic - Perkins talks of the gap between 'known-knowns' and 'known-unknowns' but then blithely quantifies teaching across disparate domains as being useless by a number (in his instance, 90% but it's more that he uses any number, rather than a statement that acknowledges context sensativity of different disciplines). I thought Caroline Wake's comment was spot on re the limitations, but also the insights, that Perkins offers."
