----,"Declan Alexander McLeman",comment,student,Summarisation,"There are three operations on a boolean value: conjunction(AND), disjunction(OR) or negation(!=1).There is only one proper error, and that is in the properties section, where a+(b+c)=(a+b)c, when it is supposed to be: a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c.Also, if the results are not restricted to being 0 or 1, the second last result in the truth table should be 2, not 1. Two expressions are assumed equal if their respective truth tables are equal."

----,"Roy Dylan Porter",comment,student,,"Three operations.Conjunction, Disjunction and Negation.Conjunctions is A * B or AB and A and B must be the same to get the result.Disjunction is A + B and if either A or B is 1, it becomes 1.Negation essentially turns a 1 into a 0 and a 0 into a 1.When you get an expression such as a+b+c' you create a 'truth table' where a, b and c are all possible combinations of 0 and 1, and then you find the result of the equations.If the results of two truth tables are the same, the equations are 'Equivalent'"

----,"Francisco Esteban Acosta Arroyo",comment,student,,"This video explains what is Boolean Algebra and the manipulation of Boolean Expressions.Boolean Algebra is defined by three ingredients.Values: defined by 0, 1.Operations: that are Conjunction, Disjunction and Negation.Symbols: represented as any (x,y,a,b,..)Each operation has their respective rules:Conjunction: it is represented as an ""*"" between symbols or just the symbols next to each other. The way it works is that it will return 1 as long as both symbols are 1.Disjunction: It is represented with a ""+"" symbol and it returns 1 if any of the symbols is 1.Negation: It is represented with a prime, it works on a single value and it translates to the opposite value of the symbol.The operations have commutative and associative properties.Boolean Expressions: These are expressions that are obtained from combining the 3 ingredients and these expressions have what is called TRUTH TABLES.Truth tables have as many rows as possible depending on the combination of symbol values.They also have 1 column for each symbol and 1 column for the result.The values of the result on a truth table represent all the possible values to test that results.There's another case when two expressions have the same identical values on every case from their truth table, this means these expressions are equivalent"
