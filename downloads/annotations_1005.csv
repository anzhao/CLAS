----,"Rob Reed",comment,student,,"It's interesting to reflect on the fact that our traditional approach is based on the mediaeval technology of having students 'transcribe' the book which was being read out by the person at the lectern (lecturer, from Latin, lectura meaning literally 'a reading'). I reckon we can free ourselves from the tyranny of mediaeval technology and do better?cheersRob"
00:02:57,"Denise Wood",annotation,student,"strategies for engaging students in the flipped classroom?","Rob, you have highlighted the benefits of the flipped classroom model as well as the challenges. In my experience the primary resistance to the flipped classroom model is (as you describe), that face-to-face sessions are predicated on the understanding that students have completed the preliminary reading and watched the required video presentation prior to the session. We have all had the experience of wasting valuable time at the start of face-to-face sessions going over material that students should have prepared for in advance (and in the process disengaged those more diligent students who have prepared as required). Do you think this form of video annotation might be more effective in encouraging students to engage in the preliminary work prior to their face-to-face (or real-time virtual) sessions? Would assigning marks to student participation/collaboration via the video prior to the associated tutorial be effective do you think?"
00:05:02,"Martin Turner",annotation,student,"preparing before class","I agree ... supporting people to prepare before 'class' is key ... when I first used a 'flip classroom' model in 2007 at a uni with one campus and no distance students, one of the things we focused on in the redesign of the course was how to support students to prepare before class ... one of my long-term mentors, Tom Angelo (possibly best known as one of the authors of the book 'Classroom Assessment Techniques'), suggested I try using SPAs (Session Preparation Assignments), which are a form of structured reflective learning journal ... and although Tom is often critical that I do not use SPAs in quite as thorough and well-supported way as he (and others) would suggest, this technique has worked well for me over the past 7 years ... quite a few accounting students in my courses make comments such as 'this is the first course where I actually did all the readings'... There are some other techniques in the accounting education literature that I am aware of, where people use various techniques to support people to read before f2f class. Often many techniques require quite a bit of work from the lecturer ... whatever methods we use, it does need to not use too much of our time ... but the key thing, is that is possible to support large numbers of people in a course to read before class ... even in a large first year accounting course for non-accountants, where many students are fearful and not initially interested in the course/discipline.

----,"Ritesh Chugh",comment,student,flipped,"Thanks Rob! Great insight into Flipping Classrooms.Students perhaps see more value in getting F2F interactions with instructors rather than a complete 'flip'. What could be trialled is short videos by the instructor about the weekly content and then it gets supplemented by the F2F lectures. However the cacophony in all this is that we should also look to produce full length videos for DE students(or students who may have missed class) without taking away the traditional mode completely. It sounds like a blended approach ( or more like me sitting on the fence)!! ïƒ Ritesh"
----,"Denise Wood",comment,student,"Flipped classroom responses","Thanks Ritesh and Martin for checking out the video and this software.What do you think of the annotation software concept?"
00:01:21,"Julie Fleming",annotation,student,"quality time","I think Rob has hit the nail on the head with one of the very positive ways to use the flipped classroom, i.e. it allows for quality engagement when students and lecturer then come together."
