----,"Siyi Chen",comment,student,,"This video explained how to encode sets of symbols.We need to encode symbols as 24 bits, with 2 bits of code (ADD 00, MUL 10, SUB 01, DIV 11), 8 bits of operand 1,  8 bits of operand 2 and 6 bits all zeros."

00:06:11,"Wing Kiu Ng",annotation,student,,"the 2nd operand can have any number between 0 and 255"
----,"Wing Kiu Ng",comment,student,,"The video describes the method for encoding symbols. What determine this type of encoding include the number of bits and the corresponding symbols. The number of bits is related to the number of combinations. For example if there are 8 combinations, 3 bits are needed since 8 = 2^3. The bits are represented by the power of base 2.UAL- 1 is another way for encoding symbols. It is determined by three parts: the code, operand 1 and operand 2. The code consists of (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) while both operands can have any number between 0 and 255."
----,"Brendan Allan March",comment,student,,"This video describes how to encode a set of symbols.1) Choose no. of bits (n) to encode set symbols with, using the formula 2^n &gt;= |Set|.2) Describe how the symbols are going to be encoded [ie: how to interpret the string of n bits].The video then gives an example of this process."
