00:00:00,"Jeffrey Koh",annotation,student,workshop,"I like the idea of 'workshop' as classroom. This works particularly well in my classes as they are small (&lt;20) so it's much more manageable. Besides getting more interaction in such a style, students also have the ability to learn from one another."
00:01:53,"Jeffrey Koh",annotation,student,multimedia,"Use of multimedia and multimodal interaction is essential in the creative practices."
00:02:52,"Jeffrey Koh",annotation,student,variety,"using different modalities and teaching activities allows for many types of students to have opportunities to participate."
00:03:35,"Jeffrey Koh",annotation,student,polling,"in-class polling is also an interesting activity."
----,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",comment,student,"Claudio Cazorla","""Effective process and free contents rather than just contents and no process"". I find this concept very interesting. It connects to the idea that educational courses must focus more on ""learning how to learn"" rather than just aiming the student to know a particular ensemble of contents independently of their significance or the processes that have been involved in working them out. In my case, (I teach Materials Science courses to undergraduates in University) knowing the processes and being able to apply them within different contexts as ""deducing tools"", is really the point I make through my whole teaching activity.    When you want to show some particular points to your students having an option B"" in your teaching strategy may be fine. This is a demonstration that you are flexible in your teaching approach and also communicative with your students, which I think is very positive. Of course, preparing options B involves increasing your time load devoted to planning and preparing lectures, but I think that the efforts are worth."
00:02:46,"Colin Clark",annotation,student,,"All seems fairly obvious so far - it is important to break up lectures to reset the attention curve of students."
----,"Colin Clark",comment,student,,"I can't say I was terribly impressed with this - it seems rambling and rather general."
----,"Hossein Masoumi",comment,student,,"I use a similar approach in my courses known as effective learning environment where all the class has high level of engagement during the lecture"
00:03:28,"Wen Hu",annotation,student,,"Prepare for backup option when things/activties don't work out."
----,"Wen Hu",comment,student,,"I find that case studies are always interesting."
00:00:56,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I believe that ""workshop-style"" lectures can be very effective with a group of students that is not too large, and where most people are interested / engaged with the topic. It is, at the same time, a risky activity to manage as one must be confident and able to keep the situation under control."
00:01:38,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"The use of video as an activity is very effective. Students like to watch videos and seem to remember their content much better than the one from the readings... They are also to visualise an issue and listen to the perspective of different people, rather than purely that of an author."
00:02:09,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"This method seems useful to contextualise the topic in an actual case study, shown in the video. I have also used this approach before and it has proven to be helpful in starting a class discussion and encouraging students to share their views and take on the topic."
----,"Valentina Bau",comment,student,,"This video did not show anything particularly new to me, but it did bring together some useful concepts that encourage me to think more about class discussion, the use of different types of visual materials as part of an activity, and the ability to keep the class interactive throughout the duration of the lecture."
00:00:16,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"content vs process - very difficult mindset to get out of, when my learning experiences revolved around this."
00:00:59,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"Trying to actively engage students can be difficult, using humour and real-life examples are good ways to engage."
00:03:11,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"Be flexible with activities, back-up options are helpful. Seems like there is an emphasis on being prepared."
----,"Anna Yeung",comment,student,,"I think the main point of this video is that getting students actively involved is an integral part of the learning process but flexibility is needed to achieve this."
00:00:25,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,"Effective process feeds content",
00:00:53,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,,"Relaxed, open, flexible in the lecture...let's see where the students take things"
00:01:50,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,,"Using video to contextualize and to make it easy for students to understand"
00:03:23,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,,"You should have backup options"
----,"Ateeq Rauf",comment,student,Flexibility,"The video discusses the openness of the instructor to keep things flexible, innovate with devices such as videos and have backup options. So an instructor is not bound by content, rather he or she is willing to mould the session according to students' responses. The instructor's class is student centered, e.g. video helps students grasp the situation. One question I would have is how to bring back students to the point you want to make, if things wander away or do not go as expected."
00:01:11,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Teaching style","Guiseppe's point is that the how of teaching is equally as important as the what. His teaching style appears to be interactive and entertaining. I can imagine that this could be effective in keeping audience attention. It requires a whole different skill set to traditional lecturing and the confidence and ability to carry this type of interaction."
00:03:46,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Option B","In class activities may not always work out, preparation and experience is required to bring the class back on track."
----,"Till Boecking",comment,student,"Interactive lectures","I agree that way that course material is conveyed is important. New appraoches such as the interactive style used by Guiseppe are worth a try and could be effective and fun (for students and lecturer). This will need some careful thought and preparation. Probably worth some trial and error."
----,"Sonia Graham",comment,student,,"As a Sydney University graduate, I remember regularly falling asleep in one of these lecture theatres during first year chemistry. Despite being a keen student, once the lights were dimmed and the powerpoint started I couldn't help but fall asleep. I think an approach like this would have been invaluable for keeping me awake and engaged, and less panicked at the end of semester when I was worried that I had missed too much content. Although, my sleep did motivate me to study extra hard and it ended up being my highest mark that semester."
00:01:49,"Daniel Mansfield",annotation,student,relevance,"Here he makes the learning relevant to their lives. That's a great way to engage students."
00:03:19,"Daniel Mansfield",annotation,student,alignment,"Align your activity with what you are trying to achieve. His advice is simple and important."
----,"Daniel Mansfield",comment,student,,"If this lecture is a large tutorial, why not make it a tutorial?"
00:00:21,"Corey Martin",annotation,student,"Importance of process","Effective process is as important as content for teaching."
00:00:47,"Corey Martin",annotation,student,Flexibility,"Helpful to be relaxed and flexible in lectures."
----,"Corey Martin",comment,student,"General Comment","I like the fact that Guiseppe sought engagement with his students and used a variety of tools to stimulate discussion. What I find difficult in large classes is being able to engage everyone as often only a few students feel comfortable to speak up and engage with the content, also you can see in the video that some students in the background were totally disengaged in his lecture."
00:03:08,"Corey Martin",annotation,student,"use of different media","I already find that the use of videos help solidify and assist the students in their learning."
00:01:13,"Margarita Mandic",annotation,student,,"It is a good idea to periodically check if students are still ""in tune"" and understand concepts as the class progresses."
00:01:49,"Margarita Mandic",annotation,student,,"Great idea to link theory with real life examples/practices- gives students a better understanding of how they can apply particular concept outside of classroom."
00:02:59,"Margarita Mandic",annotation,student,,"Small group discussion with your peers is a good idea to encourage opinion sharing and interaction."
----,"Margarita Mandic",comment,student,,"I like the approach of Giuseppe- he blends lecture style presentation with group discussions and therefore shifting the power to students to engage, share opinions and ideas. The professor is relaxed and easily approachable. He establishes a good learning environment and diminishes possible intimidation from students."

----,"Fiona Nicolson",comment,student,,"It's interesting to see Giuseppe standing in amongst his students rather than standing out the front where he is less accessible. He encourages his teaching colleagues to try new teaching strategies but also mentions the importance of a plan b - I think this is great because he recognises that some things may not always work out, but that's actually ok if you have something else up your sleeve."
00:00:21,"Julie Thoms",annotation,student,"Effective process feeds content",
00:00:54,"Julie Thoms",annotation,student,"Seeing where the students take things","I like that Giuseppe is open to (expects to?) learn from his students"

00:03:22,"Julie Thoms",annotation,student,"Back up options","Always a good idea to have a plan B!"
----,"Julie Thoms",comment,student,,"I like that Giuseppe has the expectation that the students will contribute to and guide the discussion. It's obvious that he has reflected upon his previous teaching experiences when he talks about including examples that help inexperienced learners conceptualize. I also like that he is using the class discussion to get a ""real time"" indication of has a how well students are understanding the matrerial, and has a plan b if things are not turning out as expected."
00:00:00,"Mariam Farida",annotation,student,"carabetta video","i really like the way Carabetta was giving his lecture, he looked pretty relaxed with the large number of students, and he was able to engage them in funny and entertaining context-related Ads. i agree with him that whatever students are learning has to make sense in their own world, in a way to have it fit their environment so that they can relate to it and learn it fast. in my current teaching course, where i am teaching arabic as a second language, i once asked students about their studying strategy, most of the answers was when they personalise the vocabulary. in other words, when they use the new vocabulary they are learning and create a personal story out of it. this way, students felt that they were able to memorise and contextualise the new vocabulary.another way i agree to make the content personal enough for the students is that when i am teaching them about Arabic language, they are always reminded of the variety of spoken colloquial languages, i often teach them this through watching plays, videos, songs, and when they had native students visiting, where they conduct conversations with them. also we have created a number of assessments that students enjoy the content of the course and make it personal, such as cultural blogs, where students interact with a cultural aspect of the arabic background and integrate it into how this is different for them.i find that this is very helpful because it allows students to interact more in class and learn the material quicker and much more fun. which will also make the teachers' role easier as they will interact in class."
----,"Mariam Farida",comment,student,"carabetta video","in summary i totally agree with Carabetta video in terms of allowing students to interact and personalise the learning content. 1- it will allow students to enjoy the material 2- learn it much quicker and much more efficiently 3-allow the class to flow smoothly with end-results4-makes the teachers' role much more effective5-allowing more space for students to be innovative and to feel entitled, which will get them to feel responsible and efficient6-it will also be good to have a backup plan, because not every time students are ready to be engaged so the teacher has to always prepare a plan Bit is much more efficient when students are 100% engaged in class, and through activities that they can relate to real life, they are ensured to participate in class."

00:02:45,"Peter Nangle",annotation,student,,"Group discussion in a lecture. Nice"
----,"Nicholas Richardson",comment,student,,"I use videos all the time but I do teach advertising so there is little option really. I do use discussion and the videos are always used as an example to illustrate conceptual or theoretical material."

----,"Peter Nangle",comment,student,,"Good to see a lecturer trying to transform a large lecture into something more engaging and interactive."
----,"Blake Cochran",comment,student,,"having the students to engage with one another first rather than just ask 'cold call' questions where students are unlikely to answer. Also, discussion allows for more free thinking rather than face embarrassment of answering incorrectly."

00:00:29,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"Process vs Content","I hadn't really thought about this in my teaching practise. It is true, I have a tendency to focus on the getting through the content rather than trying to help the process of learning about the principles I am trying to teach. I feel this will be a big hurdle for me to overcome"
00:00:49,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"First year vs Higher Year","I haven't taught any higher year classes yet but I feel this could be a great approach to getting my first year students a little more involve and interested in the content"
----,"Saud Albaqami",comment,student,,"It is a good technique to make the lecture more engagement oriented that attract students and make students involved but there are some issues to be considered:There is a need for time to prepare the content.The students should be divided in small groups.Having displayed the videos , the students themselves should be doing some brainstorming to discuss their viewpoints."
----,"Samantha Furfari",comment,student,"General Comments","There are a few take home points for me from this video:Carabetta seems very relaxed and engaged with the students, some of this may be experience. I feel like that if I was to put some of the focus back on the students it would also relax me more in front of the class rather than rushing through content. I also would like to try Carabetta's strategy of using activities for higher year students and apply them to first year students"
00:00:27,"Nicole Lasky",annotation,student,Workshop,"I'm interested in treating large lectures as workshops as many of our tutorials have been eliminated and the students need more interaction and active learning."
00:00:48,"Nicole Lasky",annotation,student,Flexibility,"Flexibility is the sign of an experienced person.  They focus not only on what they are doing, but on their environment.  They can then adapt to the environment quickly."
00:01:07,"Nicole Lasky",annotation,student,Playfulness,"Having a playful attitude with students really helps in gaining approval and engagement."
00:02:40,"Nicole Lasky",annotation,student,"Paired participation","It's a good idea to have people people pair off to participate as this is a lot easier for those that are shy and may not participate with the whole class. This way everyone can be active."
----,"Nicole Lasky",comment,student,Workshop,"I like how Giuseppe treats a large lecture as a workshop.  He demonstrates how it is possible to have activities in large classes and moves away from the mindset that a formal lecture needs to be provided for large groups."
00:00:20,"Nicole Lasky",annotation,student,Process,"I like how he self-reflected on his teaching and realized that he was only focused on content and then incorporated a focus on process as well.  Too many lecturers only focus on content."
00:00:26,"Shev MacNamara",annotation,student,,"I also would like to try this in my lecture - in mathematics it might be more about getting students to solve problems themselves though, as opposed to lecture droning at the board"
00:01:00,"Shev MacNamara",annotation,student,,"If you are more flexible (which i like), how do you ensure that you check all the boxes on a rigid syllabus with already too much content?"
00:02:59,"Shev MacNamara",annotation,student,,"The video and then discussion sounds a great way to stimulate learning, but i don't know if it helps to personalise the experience."
----,"Shev MacNamara",comment,student,,"students remember what they do, not what someone says."
00:00:26,"Claire Kain",annotation,student,,"The idea of content versus process is a very interesting one and one that really needs balancing.I'm not necessarily convinced that treating EVERY lecture like a workshop is the way to go though. I believe variety is important to cater to different learning styles and different content types."
00:00:59,"Claire Kain",annotation,student,,"Flexibility and a relaxed teaching style seems really important for this style of teaching. He encourages the students to participate and makes them feel at ease."
00:03:33,"Claire Kain",annotation,student,,"I'm impressed with the student engagement. I think the Option B is important too - this would help the lecturer take a more relaxed approach too."
----,"Claire Kain",comment,student,,"I was interested to see how Giuseppe managed to engage such a large class in this sort of activity - it worked well and they all seemed to be actively listening and/or participating.I'm not convinced that every lecture should be run this way - it really does depend on content in my opinion. I also believe students need variety, because learning styles are very personalised and what works for somebody may not work for somebody else."
00:00:35,"Gayathri Sundaram",annotation,student,"Composed Teacher","I really loved his way of teaching and engaging with students. Communication between him and the students is active and productive."
