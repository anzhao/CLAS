00:00:21,"Corey Martin",annotation,student,"Importance of process","Effective process is as important as content for teaching."
00:00:47,"Corey Martin",annotation,student,Flexibility,"Helpful to be relaxed and flexible in lectures."
00:03:08,"Corey Martin",annotation,student,"use of different media","I already find that the use of videos help solidify and assist the students in their learning."
----,"Corey Martin",comment,student,"General Comment","I like the fact that Guiseppe sought engagement with his students and used a variety of tools to stimulate discussion. What I find difficult in large classes is being able to engage everyone as often only a few students feel comfortable to speak up and engage with the content, also you can see in the video that some students in the background were totally disengaged in his lecture."
----,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",comment,student,"Claudio Cazorla","""Effective process and free contents rather than just contents and no process"". I find this concept very interesting. It connects to the idea that educational courses must focus more on ""learning how to learn"" rather than just aiming the student to know a particular ensemble of contents independently of their significance or the processes that have been involved in working them out. In my case, (I teach Materials Science courses to undergraduates in University) knowing the processes and being able to apply them within different contexts as ""deducing tools"", is really the point I make through my whole teaching activity.    When you want to show some particular points to your students having an option B"" in your teaching strategy may be fine. This is a demonstration that you are flexible in your teaching approach and also communicative with your students, which I think is very positive. Of course, preparing options B involves increasing your time load devoted to planning and preparing lectures, but I think that the efforts are worth."
00:02:46,"Colin Clark",annotation,student,,"All seems fairly obvious so far - it is important to break up lectures to reset the attention curve of students."
----,"Colin Clark",comment,student,,"I can't say I was terribly impressed with this - it seems rambling and rather general."
----,"Hossein Masoumi",comment,student,,"I use a similar approach in my courses known as effective learning environment where all the class has high level of engagement during the lecture"
00:03:28,"Wen Hu",annotation,student,,"Prepare for backup option when things/activties don't work out."
----,"Wen Hu",comment,student,,"I find that case studies are always interesting."
00:00:56,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I believe that ""workshop-style"" lectures can be very effective with a group of students that is not too large, and where most people are interested / engaged with the topic. It is, at the same time, a risky activity to manage as one must be confident and able to keep the situation under control."
00:01:38,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"The use of video as an activity is very effective. Students like to watch videos and seem to remember their content much better than the one from the readings... They are also to visualise an issue and listen to the perspective of different people, rather than purely that of an author."
00:02:09,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"This method seems useful to contextualise the topic in an actual case study, shown in the video. I have also used this approach before and it has proven to be helpful in starting a class discussion and encouraging students to share their views and take on the topic."
----,"Valentina Bau",comment,student,,"This video did not show anything particularly new to me, but it did bring together some useful concepts that encourage me to think more about class discussion, the use of different types of visual materials as part of an activity, and the ability to keep the class interactive throughout the duration of the lecture."
00:00:16,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"content vs process - very difficult mindset to get out of, when my learning experiences revolved around this."
00:00:59,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"Trying to actively engage students can be difficult, using humour and real-life examples are good ways to engage."
00:03:11,"Anna Yeung",annotation,student,,"Be flexible with activities, back-up options are helpful. Seems like there is an emphasis on being prepared."
----,"Anna Yeung",comment,student,,"I think the main point of this video is that getting students actively involved is an integral part of the learning process but flexibility is needed to achieve this."
00:00:25,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,"Effective process feeds content",
00:00:53,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,,"Relaxed, open, flexible in the lecture...let's see where the students take things"
00:01:50,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,,"Using video to contextualize and to make it easy for students to understand"
00:03:23,"Ateeq Rauf",annotation,student,,"You should have backup options"
----,"Ateeq Rauf",comment,student,Flexibility,"The video discusses the openness of the instructor to keep things flexible, innovate with devices such as videos and have backup options. So an instructor is not bound by content, rather he or she is willing to mould the session according to students' responses. The instructor's class is student centered, e.g. video helps students grasp the situation. One question I would have is how to bring back students to the point you want to make, if things wander away or do not go as expected."
00:01:11,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Teaching style","Guiseppe's point is that the how of teaching is equally as important as the what. His teaching style appears to be interactive and entertaining. I can imagine that this could be effective in keeping audience attention. It requires a whole different skill set to traditional lecturing and the confidence and ability to carry this type of interaction."
00:03:46,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Option B","In class activities may not always work out, preparation and experience is required to bring the class back on track."
----,"Till Boecking",comment,student,"Interactive lectures","I agree that way that course material is conveyed is important. New appraoches such as the interactive style used by Guiseppe are worth a try and could be effective and fun (for students and lecturer). This will need some careful thought and preparation. Probably worth some trial and error."
----,"Sonia Graham",comment,student,,"As a Sydney University graduate, I remember regularly falling asleep in one of these lecture theatres during first year chemistry. Despite being a keen student, once the lights were dimmed and the powerpoint started I couldn't help but fall asleep. I think an approach like this would have been invaluable for keeping me awake and engaged, and less panicked at the end of semester when I was worried that I had missed too much content. Although, my sleep did motivate me to study extra hard and it ended up being my highest mark that semester."
00:01:49,"Daniel Mansfield",annotation,student,relevance,"Here he makes the learning relevant to their lives. That's a great way to engage students."
00:03:19,"Daniel Mansfield",annotation,student,alignment,"Align your activity with what you are trying to achieve. His advice is simple and important."
----,"Daniel Mansfield",comment,student,,"If this lecture is a large tutorial, why not make it a tutorial?"
