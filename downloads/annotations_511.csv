Also when its over 9, continue it by adding A-F."

----,"Yuting Shan",comment,student,summary,"talks about how to translates from base 10 to base 2,base 2 to base 8, base 2 to base 16 and doing the reverse translation. Base 10 to base 2: divide the actual number by 2 and use remainder to find the others.Base 2 to base 8: break it into 3 groups and then write down the remainders for each groups after divided by 8Base 2 to base 16: break into 4 groups and apply the same methods as from base 2 to 8"

----,"David John Farr",comment,student,"Bit Encoding Video Summary","There was 4 types of base encoding highlighted in the video:(i) Decimal or Base 10 [0...9](ii) Binary or Base 2 [0,1](iii) Octal or Base 8 [0...7](iv) Hexadecimal or Base 16 [0...9,A...F]The methods of translating between bases are as follows:(1) Base 10 -&gt; Base 2: use successive division by the value 2 until you reach 0. The remainders of each step represent each bit of the binary sequence. The first remainder obtained represents the least significant bit and the last is the most significant. The bit sequence goes from high to low significance.(2) Base 2 -&gt; Base 10: each bit corresponds to the increasing power of 2 from right to left (2^0, 2^1, 2^2 etc). Discard the zero values in the binary sequence and then multiply each 1 value with its corresponding power of 2. The sum of these final values will give you the decimal number (base 10).(3) Base 2 -&gt; Base 8: group all the bits in the binary sequence, as a set of 3 bits, moving from right to left. If any bits remained ungrouped in a set of 3 then simply add the required zero's to the left until 3 is achieved. Find the equivalent octal number based on each 3 bit set. Generally a zero is put at the front of an octal number to designate it.(4) Base 2 -&gt; Base 16: Same process as base 8 but instead use sets of 4.  If the equivalent hexadecimal number is greater than 9, use A...F (10...15). Hexadecimal numbers have '0x' as prefix to show what type they are.(5) Base 8 -&gt; Base 2: simply translate each one of the digits in its corresponding 3-bit binary representation.(6) Base 16 -&gt; Base 2: same process as base 8 but use 4 digits (bits) for each hexadecimal number."
00:03:04,"David John Farr",annotation,student,"Significance of Bits in Binary","The first remained encountered represents the least significant bit in the sequence while the last represents the highest significance.The bit sequence is in order of highest to lowest (left to right)"
00:06:07,"David John Farr",annotation,student,"Octal Definition","An Octal number of Base 8 number is represented by 8 bits, 0...7.A 0 digit is used as a prefix to indicate that it is an octal number."
00:13:43,"David John Farr",annotation,student,"Hexadecimal Abbreviation","Hexadecimal, and also Octal numbers can be used to abbreviate binary numbers.For a hexadecimal number, each digit represents 4 bits found in the binary sequence. Commonly used for errors and memory address."
