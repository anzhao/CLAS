00:01:14,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I'm most convinced by the argument that many students will learn the content of a lecture better (and deeper) if they have the option to start and stop a lecture recording as required, rather than having to try to keep up while sitting in a lecture theatre!"
00:01:46,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of starting each lecture with an open quiz to get people engaged and ready for the session!"
00:02:00,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"As a lecturer in a big course, who doesn't run any tutorials myself, I'm very much attracted to the option of getting more direct connections with a greater number of students, through the flipped classroom model."
00:02:36,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Great ideas about how to share responses - by identifying those groups most likely to be most interesting/different and actively asking them to share, you avoid the issue of students being unwilling to share their ideas in case they look silly."
00:03:35,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Amazing to think of all the possibilities afforded by recording group activities in lecture sessions, so students can access them later!"
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"I've heard a little about flipped classrooms before, but this video has given me lots of concrete ideas about what is possible through this approach, I really like it! It's a bit daunting to think about the work required to set it up, recording the (short) videos beforehand, for example, but the benefits for student learning are clear, and I think the students I teach would really love it. Lots of things for me to think about now in terms of restructuring my course for next year..."
00:01:27,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"Cutting down","It's interesting to hear that the traditional lecture was cut down from 50 mins to 12-15 mins. What content was cut out? Was this content used during the flipped classroom time?"
00:02:03,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"Lecture theatre design","It's interesting to see that although the flipped classroom is being used, the room itself is not equipped to handle the group work. What sort of things can lecturers do to make the most of the current spaces provided for giving lectures?"
00:03:02,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,filming,"I like the idea of getting students to contribute their ideas to the rest of the cohort, but what about considerations for students who would like to contribute but are not necessarily comfortable being filmed? It makes me think of what I could do to get the quieter ones more involved in class discussion, whilst not making them feel like they are being isolated for being quiet."
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,"flipped classroom","The flipped classroom is certainly more dynamic. Having been a student in one course that employs it, it does force you to think much more critically about the content. I would still like to know about more ways to include quieter students in discussion without making them feel isolated. ie. how can the flipped classroom be made more inclusive rather than just providing an outlet for the most vocal students?"
00:00:19,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Right off the bat, I am not sure how relevant this is to my current teaching practice, as I only teach small groups (usually around 20-30 students, at any rate capped at 44). But I've taught big lectures in the past, so, we'll see."
00:01:02,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Yes, the lecture time is cut down, but I would think part of the ""efficiency"" is because there is no time for discussions anymore.And maybe it's a lack of student conditioning for this model, but, in my flipped classroom experience, students who do not understand a concept in the video are unlikely to make a note of the question and bring it to class for discussion.I don't know, I think I'm too much of a control freak to assume that any questions a student might have will resolve themselves inside the small group, during the activity."
00:01:53,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of adding a timer to the screen, I don't know why I hadn't done that before."
00:03:03,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"So, what is the rest of the class supposed to do while the few students are recording their videos? I missed that step."
----,"Lucas Lixinski",comment,student,,"It's certainly an interesting approach to flipped classrooms. We have been experimenting with some of that at the Law Faculty, and I've been involved in some flipped classroom course design. We do things a bit differently, because our groups are quite a bit smaller, but I can see a lot of similarities, too.One thing that particularly struck me about the video is the notion that all student questions can be answered if the student is able to slow down and rewind the video. From my experience, very often the information just needs to be conveyed in a different way, and, while the classroom might be an opportunity to do just that, the video didn't seem to convey there would be much space for group discussion of issues raised in the videos, just individual consultations at the end of class."
00:00:41,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"It is a good idea that they actually do some work beforhand that would go with they are to do in the classroom"
00:01:29,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"I always thought that optimizing the pace of my talks was the most difficult task when delivering a lecture! I like the idea that the talks are reproducible!"
00:02:39,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"this is infact more work than usual delivery of a lecture but it is less likely to have dead-fish faces in this type of teaching in the classroom!"
00:03:42,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"i think it is plausible that they can develop more instructive relationships with their instructor"
----,"Apo Demirkol",comment,student,,"I think this could be viable in my teaching but I am aware of the fact that it is a lot of work! For a conjoint, it is a daunting thought!"
00:00:52,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"It sounds good in theory. But there are some issues. First, organising 200+ students into groups each lecture is a pretty big logistical challenge for just one lecturer. A lot of time can be lost just getting things arrange. Second, some classroom (lecture theatre) layouts aren't that conducive for group work (i.e., they have been designed for lecture formats); and third,we need to take into account how this approach might affect SEADU students"
00:03:35,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"It would be interesting to see student feedback to gather their perspective on the approach. Also, I wonder if this approach is more conducive from some disciplines more than others."
----,"Paul Munro",comment,student,,"It seems like a really interesting approach, and I would like to experiment with it (perhaps try it out for one or two weeks next semester) before implementing it in full. I am wondering about tutorials? How do they link into this approach?"
00:00:45,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"That's an interesting concept using vidoes- It seems similar to what I have done in the past such as asking students to read a paper or watch a documentary before coming to a seminar or tutorial...only works when they actually do it though!!"
00:01:39,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"Ok- that's a good idea to ensure student's have actually watched the lecture. very interesting, I have never heard of this before!"
00:03:33,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"I'm actually really impressed by this. It's a really innovative strategy. I would be very interested to learn much more about this. I suppose there must be different in class activities that could be implemented. I would definitely like to explore what these would be."
00:03:38,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"I guess one of my questions would be how feasible it is to make students complete a quiz each class. While I am all for this, in my experience at least here, I think the students would revolt! On the other hand, making each worth minimal marks might not be enough to ensure they all participate consistently which would then create some problems with the group work."

00:00:00,"Leonie Ligertwood",annotation,student,"Physical environment","I'd previously thought that a traditional lecture theatre would be antithetical to the implementation of the flipped classroom.  I was most impressed - he managed the learning process simply and effectively."
00:01:30,"Alishia Williams",annotation,student,,"12 min lectures?? Sounds good in theory, but probably a challenge to cover all content traditionally covered in a semester. But that raises the question of whether we try to cram in too much information."
00:02:46,"Alishia Williams",annotation,student,,"I'm pro technological aids - but from experience know that when we become too reliant upon them and the technology fails (video recording, link to upload etc) chaos can result."
00:00:00,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,"watching videos","I like the idea of students watching a video and then doing group exercises in class. I could use this, as some of my material is quite dry. I've also made the videos, so am ready to go!"
----,"Sue Williamson",comment,student,,"This approach is very interesting. My students have commented that some of the material in my course is a little dry, so this would certainly help to make it more interesting. I've already done the videos too, which would help me. But then, I wonder about tutorials - how would tutorial activities be different?"
00:03:42,"Dianne Anagnos",annotation,student,,"A huge improvement to the lecture-style approach for large groups.  However it also seems quite resource- intensive for the teacher.  I teach much smaller groups where there is time for small-group work and for all students to present their work to the larger group and ask questions along the way, but this may still be worth exloring."
00:00:42,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"The lecture room looks unsuitable to group work"
00:01:26,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"Do lecturers get training on how to lecture to a video camera? Seems like a good idea"
00:03:28,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"What about introverts? Does this model apply better to extroverts?"
00:00:42,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,"lecture room","The business school has constructed a number of 'flipped classrooms'. Good to see that the 'traditional' space can be used in a flipped manner."
00:02:16,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,camera,"Neat use of common technology to capture group outcomes"
00:01:50,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,clock,"I've used the clock in exams, but it's a neat idea for groupwork as well"
----,"Jeff Coulton",comment,student,,"Some good examples of using a traditional space in a flipped way - ie we don't have to rely on specifically redesigned teaching spaces. Like the use of the phone camera and countdown."
00:03:42,"Thomas McConochie",annotation,student,,"This is the first flipped classroom I have seen in the form of a lecture. It looks like the lecture has become a large tutorial session. If that is the case, then what is the point of having ""lectures""?"
00:01:19,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"I can see a real benefit to student learning  through the flipped classroom model. The current course I teach does not upload the Lectures for obvious reasons however, the ability of students to stop rewind and go over content definitely can enhance student learning."
00:02:10,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"Creating the space for more one on one time with the students to see learning in action and to answer questions is certainly valuable for student engagement and deep learning."
00:03:42,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"I like the interactive nature of the flipped classroom Model and the ability of the teacher to  spend more one on one time with students. I would be interested in student feedback and how different personalities felt participating."
00:01:37,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"An interesting overview of flipped classroom but doesn't seem to be a good example of a type of physical classroom to 'flip' ie the steep tiered seating, inability to change seating direction and size of room don't seem conducive to forming groups for more interactive and participatory student engagement. Although, given most lecture theatures have this physical structure and its inherent limitations, maybe they used this example because it represents that type of rooms that flipped teaching is trying to take place within."
00:01:40,"Ginu Rajan",annotation,student,,"Normally in standard class room teaching, students just turn-up without any idea of what being in the lecture. But in flipped classroom approach, it is necessary that the students should watch the video before the class. So the question is how effective is this?, and how practical it is. In my opinion at least 50% might turn up without watching. In such a scenario, how can we make the teaching effective"
00:00:36,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"online lecture","Students are asked to watch a lecture online before coming to class- I wonder how common Flipped classroom is at UNSW and how happy/resistant students would be to putting in a fair amount of time both before and after class?"
00:00:46,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Students group up into small groups","This sounds like a very large tutorial. What is the role of the tutorial then and what gets covered/what activities?"
00:01:03,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"The lecture is cut down","The lecture is cut down significantly (around 1/4 - 1/2 of what it would normally take)- I find this fascinating- what are we spending half the lecture doing ? Does he just go through the material faster because he knows students can re-watch parts that they find confusing? I think that even though the lecture content is cut down, most (conscientious) students will still need to spend a full hour going back and forth through the material."
00:01:26,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"students can slow down or re-watch the video","I think this is great, that the lecture is recorded and available so that students can view it as many times as they need to."
00:01:41,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Students complete an open note quiz","I think this would be very useful and that you would probably have to use a quiz to ensure that students do the online work before coming to class. From what I know about Flipped Classroom, sometimes the quiz is given online before the class-time so that the teacher can see what topics students are struggling with, and address these in the Face to Face."
00:01:48,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"Students form together as groups","I wonder what the group size is? I agree with Lincoln-it doesn't look very easy for the groups to come together in the traditional lecture theatre design."
00:02:56,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"student responses are recorded","I like how student's work is recorded both by still shots and video- I can imagine this would be very useful for students when studying for final exams."
00:03:21,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"students can ask questions at the end","I wonder if this approach would encourage the shy students to ask questions?"
----,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",comment,student,,"I find this approach really exciting- flipped classroom changes the role of the lecturer from one who presents the material, to one who presents the material beforehand and then moderates the flow of ideas and discussion in a workshop type environment. I wonder how common flipped classroom is at UNSW and how happy/resistant students would be to putting in a fair amount of time both before and after class? For the lecturer this involves alot more work, but ultimately the results would be worth it, as you are teaching your students to think critically and analyse the information you give them. I would really like to try this in one lecture coming up."
----,"Peyman Mostaghimi Qomi",comment,student,,"To me the flipped classroom seems an excellent idea. However, I think it will need some sort of modifications based on the course content. For some courses, students will need specific resources to be able to complete their learning in the classroom. I would like to know if this scheme has ever been tried at UNSW and what was the experience of the lecturer."
----,"Mark Reed",comment,student,,"this is an interesting model - I can see how it works when all students spend time prior to the class - my experience is that students not so prepared - then the experience would be very bad and they would be totally lost in the class"
00:03:42,"Mark Reed",annotation,student,,"interesting model - it relies on students doing prep - most don't"
00:01:16,"Yun Hau Ng",annotation,student,,"The idea is interesting. Would it be more or less similar with ECHO360 implemented in CATS lecture room? Students can listen to the recorded lectures and do revision as many times as they like with their own preferred pace. The only difference is in flipped classroom the students are supposed to watch (or learn?) it before they attend the lecture. Same things could be done by loading the previously recorded (say last year)ECHO360 lecture before each class."
00:01:58,"Yun Hau Ng",annotation,student,,"Would that be more tutorial-type instead of lecture? I guess the main challenge for my course would be how to make sure the students done the study before they attend to the class, especially when the class size is large. If the students come without prior studying (not just watching) the topic, the whole lecture would be just ineffective at all??!!"
00:03:02,"Yun Hau Ng",annotation,student,,"Do we need to get the students consent before recording them? I reckon not everyone is happy to be filmed and put on publicly accessed medium."
----,"Yun Hau Ng",comment,student,,"This is an interesting model.I guess the main challenge for my course would be how to make sure the students done the study (not just watching the video) before they attend the class. If the students come without prior study, does that mean the whole lecture would be meaningless for them at all, as the activities designed are for those prepared ones?"
00:00:16,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"Smaller classes","I love the idea of smaller classes cut down from 200 plus pax."
00:00:30,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"Watching videos","Ahhh...but will students be disciplined enough to do the pre-wprk...doubtful."
00:01:23,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"Review and relax","Wonderful that students can go throug hthe material at their own pace so long as the original delivery is clear and coherent."
00:03:42,"Tom Kramer",annotation,student,"Engaging - fun","The classes are fun and engaging..new methods are always interesting and usually inspirational."
00:00:19,"Ronald Ting Tai Chan",annotation,student,"What is a flip classroom?","The concept is basically to ask the students and lecturer to switch role during lecture time."
----,"Tom Kramer",comment,student,,"I love the idea that the information dump and delivery is short and sharp. I think the use of reviewable video is especially fantastic as English challenged students can go at their own pace...BUT will students do the preliminary work for the class??!!??"
00:01:07,"Ronald Ting Tai Chan",annotation,student,"Time Efficiency?","I'm not so sure that this is a definite way to 'save time'. I agree that in a class size of 30-60. Breaking up students into groups help to encourage thinking and the lecturer to provide individual support. However, in a class of 200, it would be almost impossible to provide assistance to all the groups in a time-efficient manner."
00:01:27,"Ronald Ting Tai Chan",annotation,student,"Students can do it at their own pace","This part I agree. This is especially important as many students are not naive English speakers. Giving them the ability to playback the lecture at any time will definitely help them to learn. One drawback would be the lecturer has to be very careful of what has being recorded especially if confidential information is involved e.g. performance discussion of Coca Cola."
00:00:28,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,"Prior videos - limitations?","I wonder if there are scenarios where making students watch a recorded lecture prior to class is not advisable/optimal? - Perhaps a lecture that involves very complex mathematics, or one that can be augmented with a live experiment/demonstration?"
00:01:36,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,,"I'm not sure if it will be possible to make sure students watch the videos before attending the lecture - even with a quiz they may not care to do so. What options are available in this case? Or is this situation no different from students not paying attention in a regular class?"
00:01:47,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,,"Is this workable without the use of groups? How to deal with the issue of some group members not coming prepared, and not participating while others carry the group activities?"
----,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",comment,student,,"I have taught laboratory based courses in  a flipped mode but I'm very interested in how to make them work for more theory based courses. Some of the ideas presented are interesting but the ideas presented are for a specific course and will have be modified (perhaps quite a lot) to fit other courses. Some issue that I see others have also raised which bother me are: (1) What to do with students who don't watch the videos prior to class, even with the quiz; (2) What if activities suitable for the course cannot result in something that expressed briefly?; (3) Are there alternatives to group activities that can ensure students are engaged?; (4) Are there courses/types of courses where pre-recorded videos are sub-optimal?"
00:01:22,"Hongxu Lu",annotation,student,,"This point is very important. The students can control their learning progress. Especially when they didn't catch the words, they have chances to learn it again."
00:03:25,"Hongxu Lu",annotation,student,,"It's very insteresting to watch this impresive video. I personally think the flipped Classroom provides a lot of benefits to the students however gives some challenges to the teachers."
00:01:37,"Forrest Duxbury",annotation,student,,"I like this technique of real quizzes in the lecture. Firstly doesn't let students disengage from the droning of a lecturer, secondly encourages them to engage deep thinking to solve the quiz so that they are capable of conversing intelligently in groups with their colleagues."
00:02:24,"Forrest Duxbury",annotation,student,,"This is really nice. I can see the students needing to be prepared ahead of time, it has the capacity to fail easily if under prepared, but otherwise it brings real engagement and reflection to each lecture."
