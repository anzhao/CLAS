----,"Declan Alexander McLeman",comment,student,Summarisation,"There are three operations on a boolean value: conjunction(AND), disjunction(OR) or negation(!=1).There is only one proper error, and that is in the properties section, where a+(b+c)=(a+b)c, when it is supposed to be: a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c.Also, if the results are not restricted to being 0 or 1, the second last result in the truth table should be 2, not 1. Two expressions are assumed equal if their respective truth tables are equal."
----,"Madeline Frances Kim Pham",comment,student,Summary,"Boolean AlgebraTwo components:1). Values (0 and 1)2). Operations (Conjunction, disjunction and negation)Symbols used to represent operandsConjunction: ab = a*b-Returns 1 if both symbols are 1-Returns 0 otherwiseDisjunction: a+b-Returns 1 if either a or b is equal to 1-Returns 0 otherwiseNegation: a'-Returns the opposite value of the operand Properties:-Conjunction and disjunction are commutative and associative-(a')' = aBoolean Expressions:example: xy+z'Truth Table:Two rules:1). As many rows as possible combinations of symbol values2). One column for each symbol and one column for each result-Truth tables represent all of the possible results of a boolean expression-If two separate boolean expressions have identical truth tables, they are equivalent"
