00:00:24,"Tessa Parry",annotation,student,,"You did well to catch the rhetorical question here and give some direct questions instead"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"0:27   You did well here to catch the rhetorical question and ask some direct questions instead"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"0.36. I know we were responding as a class, but secondary school students would not all be paying attention.  Cold calling students to justify why they agreed with the rest of the class would have been effective, to ensure students know that they are responsible for their own learning."
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"0:50. You give an example later in the presentation, but a quick example straight away would help students to remember through repetition"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"1:01  Have the resource with you so you can 'talk to' the resource whilst you are explaining the activity"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"1:13  You explained what students are to gain from the activity clearly and effectively"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"1:28  Technology has been implemented at critical points to support your presentation.  Make sure you have a backup in hard copy just incase (though I am sure you did!)"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"1:46. You used good tone here to convey an interest and enjoyment in the poetry."
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"1:50. When you question the class after reading, again try to extend student answers.  Ask particular students to justify why a particular word was chosen - what does it mean? Why does this word contain more meaning compared to a similar word?"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"2:07. Try having students read out the poetry.  It keeps your eyes on the students and the student's eyes on the board"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"2:23.  These are wonderful examples of poetry, good choices."
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"2:47. Good repetition of instruction.  Maybe try having the instructions on the board or power point as well (since the screen is already there)"
----,"Tessa Parry",comment,student,,"2:57. The instruction specifying that student a begin 'right now' is extremely effective, particularly since you used good pace and tone of voice in delivering the instruction.  However, I would have students actually start straight the activity after this instruction."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"0.10 I like the way that I put the activity in context with the previous learning from the last lesson. It reminds students about learning from last time."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"0.14 I'm using ""um"" a lot here - probably means I'm not quite confident in what I'm saying."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,".41 I should have directly asked students to answer my questions rather than asking generally as hardly anyone is answering and they're very basic answers. Maybe use a brainstorming session instead."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"1.00 I think I use clear instructions here and link in what we are doing in the activity to the overall purpose."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"1.00 I look at my notes a little too much - should be more prepared about what I'm going to say."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"1.47 I like my examples - and that I go through each of them. It shows them what is expected of them in the activity."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"1.50 I do talk a lot. I could have got students more involved. Asked them to read out the poems or asked them questions directly that they needed to answer."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"2.33 I think I sound clear in the way that I'm giving the instructions about working in pairs and what is expected of them."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"I could model the text that they are going to use a little more clearly and be more definite with my hand movements."
----,"Ruth Patching",comment,student,,"Generally I think that I sounded pretty confident and clear - I could have maybe used a little more enthusiasm at different points (such as reading out the poems) to make the activity sound like it was going to be interesting!"
