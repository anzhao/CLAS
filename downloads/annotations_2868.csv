00:00:23,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Key words: constructive criticism, suggestions about how to improve students' work and performances"
00:00:38,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Giving feedback besides marks makes students understand better their performance. Without a feedback students may not understand what went well and what needs to be improved."
00:01:21,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"The student with the pink T-shirt is saying that direct communication with his teachers is auspicable. On the contrary asking for feedback to all his teachers can be tiring."
00:01:25,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"General feedback with general comments about class performance in a test can be beneficial. Pointing out the common mistakes and ask students to reflect and correct them is a very good strategy to give feedback and promote peer editing. But general feedback should always come together with a personalised feedback about a particular aspect of a test or a performance in general."
00:01:54,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"I like the idea of starting the course with assessments that don't weight much and then little by little they become more substantiosl and they have a bigger value"
00:03:24,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"It is important to have a rubric for our assessments in order to share with students our criteria for marking"
00:03:17,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Using a rubric for our assessments makes students aware of our criteria for marking."
00:03:07,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Using a rubric when assessing makes students aware of which criteria we are applying in giving them a cartain mark."
00:00:57,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,"Seeking and knowing how to use feedback","I find this important to note that students take responsibility of making sense of their feedback and using that appropriately to improve their work."
00:02:19,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,"Stages of feedback","I like this idea of progressive feedback, first general feedback and then personalised feedback for the second and follow up assignment. It helps the student to reflect on the different stages of marking and developing the project."
00:04:48,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,"Personal feedback","I think the underlying take away for feedback in general is that the students prefer it to be relevant and personalised. That students value any feedback they get and see it as extremely important for their own development."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,"Importance of feedback","I guess what I realised with this video clip is that students really value feedback and learn from it. They want structured, but also personalised feedback to improve their work and understand where they made mistakes. I think we as lecturers can do much better with this as part of the learning process."
00:00:30,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,,"I like the fact that the student refers to feedback as constructive criticism and clearly sees the value of it."
00:01:23,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,,"It should be clear to the student where to get feedback after an assignment."
00:02:23,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,,"This is a clear example where feedback is effective in learning."
----,"Bram Hoex",comment,student,,"It is clear from this video that the students prefer a clear rubric that is used for the assessment. I agree with this view as this is in most cases the best way to ensure that assessment supports learning. Also it is clear that the students like to get personalised feedback to assist in their learning. This can, however, be quite challenging when the class size is large."
----,"Jessica Ford",comment,student,,"Students like to know what is expected of them and how they can improve. It can many forms, but the most important thing is that students find it generative"
00:01:14,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"This issue of scale is an important one"
00:03:17,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"Different levels of feedback or guidance in various courses can be problematic for students. Can we try to keep it consistent at least within your school?"
----,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",comment,student,,"Students prefer personalized feedback over general comments.Providing detailed marking criteria before the assignment is submitted could potentially help them.Need to find better ways to provide feedback for tests in larger classes where it is not possible for them to see their own papers. Peer assessments seem to be more popular than expected."
00:02:11,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Gradually increasing how much an assignment is worth is a good idea, and students tend to take that bit seriously. I tend to be harsher on those early assignments (especially if in a first-year course), to force students to up their game. Invariably a lot of my feedback is around moving students away from high school writing strategies that got them into university, but are far from helpful once they are here."
00:04:49,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"But how far do we go in personalizing? Rubrics are the only thing that keeps us afloat come marking time, and I add some comments, but I don't see how much more I can personalize without a massive time commitment. Plus, and perhaps most importantly, there will be patterns in how students do, and that's just inevitable. Academics are trained to identify patterns."
00:02:22,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"Most students seem to want personalised feedbacks while they understand it&rsquo;s heavy burden on a lecturer when a class is large."
00:03:25,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I know that ways to conduct courses are actually dependent on lecturers. We perhaps should spend more efforts to standardise lectures for students&rsquo; sake."
00:04:06,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"This is true. To give students personalised feedbacks without spending too much of my time, I may consider utilising peer reviews."
----,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",comment,student,,"Personalised feedback is certainly more effective and preferred than general feedback although it&rsquo;s often hard when a class is large. I sometime felt that I might not give enough feedbacks to students because of the limited time. I may encourage peer-reviews and self-assessments to complement my feedbacks. Also, the variation of course conducts may make students frustrated (e.g., some courses give detailed rubric, but others do not). So we may have to standardise course conducts over each school/department or university."
----,"Lopamudra Parekh",comment,student,"Lopa Parekh","Glad for our large cohort of 120 students we have 6 tutors to look after a small class of 20 students following 1 hour lecture. 3 hours of tutorial helps each tutor sufficient time to provide general feedback as well as personalised feedback to individual student. Students are provided well structured marking criteria for assessments, which helps them &amp; tutors to gauge their performance. Like the idea of peer review, however it might not be effective in 3rd semester as students are yet to develop their understanding of course content before giving a feedback to others. A general discussion prior to each tutorial can help discuss/assess any queries, challenges they might be struggling with."
00:00:00,"Haydn Washington",annotation,student,,"feedback = constructive criticismstudents feel they are fobbed off re feedback ofteninteresting when student said she didnt know how she got a good mark and teacher agreedrubric was seen as usefulstudents want useful feedback they can use, just as teachers do, needs to be personalised"
----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,,"Clearly feedback is useful when its personalised and a useful rubric. I found it interesting when one student said she didnt know how she got a good mark and teacher agreed. This seems to show a failure in explaining what is sought and how it is assessed?"
00:01:35,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,"General feedback","The problem of providing personalised feedback in large classes is highlighted, with the fact that general feedback is useful to a certain extent, but not to all students."
00:02:40,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,"Standard rubric","The rubric used is highly dependent on course coordinator, and students find standard rubrics, which are clear and detailed, helpful."
00:04:45,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,,"Feedback should be given and should be personalised!"
----,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",comment,student,Feedback,"Students prefer personalised feedback that provides constructive criticism and find it much more effective than general feedback. However, providing personalised feedback can be challenging in large classes. In addition, students find rubrics that have an explicit and detailed set of criteria with weighted marks most useful. Indeed, standard grading rubrics can help both the teachers to ensure consistency, and students to monitor their progress as they work towards clearly specified objectives."
00:00:25,"Sophie Robinson",annotation,student,,"It is important for the tutor/lecturer to consider how, as is perhaps obvious in this case, students think about feedback very personally and are quick to link it to an individualised critique that they and only they must respond to. This can be demoralising and hard for students when they can't put the 'constructive criticism' into context."
00:00:42,"Sophie Robinson",annotation,student,,"As this student rightly identifies, feedback requires an integration or link to both marks and comments, as each provide context and scope for the other."
00:00:50,"Sophie Robinson",annotation,student,,"Personalising feedback in this case can be a very positive and helpful strategy to provide students with added information and context of their grade, overall learning, and also just a sense that they aren't being totally dehumanised in the process!"
----,"Sophie Robinson",comment,student,,"Personalised feedback, it seems, is both helpful and meaningful for students and is much more likely to encourage or motivate students to then actively reflect on the comments they have received and then seek out further consultation - thereby encouraging the growth of an active learner/more diligent student."
00:01:21,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"It is difficult to provide individual feedback for larger class sizes"
00:02:23,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"Students like to get feedback so they know how to improve their work."
----,"Melinda Chylinski",comment,student,,"Students prefer personalised feedback but it is difficult for larger classes where you might be the only one who is available to mark assignments or assessments"
00:01:00,"Danny King",annotation,student,"Large class personalised feedback - solution?","Using a rubric that is quite detailed, and opening it up to students to view (turnitin has this function)"
00:02:19,"Danny King",annotation,student,"Idea to make feedback super useful","2 staged essay - small marks for first attempt, with detailed feedback at that point, major marks for second attempt that the student has had the benefit of feedback from. Not certain it works in my own course but overall it is a good idea. Extra work though."
00:03:26,"Danny King",annotation,student,"Rubrics are important","Interesting to hear how valued rubrics are by students. They are a great marking tool at the back-end but I don't release the rubric to everyone prior to releasing the final marks - otherwise I give away the answer. Maybe I am too detailed in my use of rubrics, or I can have a different version for public release without the answers actually in there."
----,"Danny King",comment,student,Rubric,"The need for feedback and the use of rubrics are both important matters and I think (in my course at least) able to be merged - where showing a very detailed rubric (which I use for problem questions to make sure the marks reflect the number of issues correctly identified), and where marks were awarded or not, can give the ""personalised"" feedback the student desires. That said, the usefulness of having the rubric in actually completing the assessment is important, and I likely need to generate 2 versions - one with the answers and one with more general indications on the allocation of marks to getting the answer correct compared to the other facets (like form, tone, appropriateness to audience etc)"
00:02:42,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise baird","students value feedback, especially if personalised to them and formative so they have a chance to improve if they are underperforming"
00:03:19,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise baird","Students like understanding how marks are assigned before the assessment, so they can understand their grade, it should be a transparent marking scheme"
00:04:17,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise baird","Peer feedback can be accurate or highly inaccurate depending on the capbilities of the student providing it. A poorer student will tell a better student their work is excellent, but won,t find ways to improve the better student in a formative way. It may however be formative for the poorer student"
----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","Students value feedback from assessment that shows the process is transparent, accountable, and understandable. They value their work, and want to understand how their work was marked. They prefer that to be individualised so they can improve. The method of feedback is not important just that its timely, clear and personalised"
00:00:31,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"constructive criticism","I really like how the student feels that feedback is constructive criticism - where he went well and what could be improved upon."
00:00:53,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"Personalised feedback","This flags the importance of personalised feedback no matter the class size. Importance of linking feedback to mark"
00:03:02,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,Rubrics,"STudents all highlighted the value of a quality rubric in guiding their focus."
----,"Kaye Chan",comment,student,"Personalised feedback","The key takeout in the importance to the students of personalised constructive feedback and the value of a quality rubric. The video highlighted a ""Stepped"" assignment approach to ensure they are on track. Biggest challenge is how to achieve this with increasing class sizes."
00:00:25,"Sara Mesgari Hagh",annotation,student,,"feed back is constructive criticism of work, that is one of the best description of it."
00:01:16,"Sara Mesgari Hagh",annotation,student,,"Is it practical to give feedback to all the students in a large class?"
00:04:42,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Personalized feedback: From a student's perspective I'd appreciate more personalized feedback. However, it is less feasible with large classes"
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"I like the concept that some students regard feedback as &lsquo;constructive criticism&rsquo;. I think this is an excellent way to look at assessment; particularly if someone considers that students learn for their future jobs rather than for the university.I find it understandable that students are keen on receiving more personalised feed-back and they are not satisfied with general feedbacks. It is a valid point to make that if someone does not commit the general mistakes but still does not receive top scores, they do not benefit from this generalised approach and cannot identify their mistakes.I also find it important to take aboard the request that students need to have full and adequate description of the marking criteria. They also wish to have &lsquo;proper feedback&rsquo; instead of just receiving a mark. This, of course, is more demanding from the teacher&rsquo;s point of view, and it may not always be fulfilled, but with small groups, this should be the proper way to go.Students do not seem to care about if the assessment is face-to-face or electronic; what they find important is that it should be personalised rather than general. Such feedback should be given as part of the consultation time."
00:02:47,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Having a transparent and detailed marking guide also helps self-evaluation"
00:01:48,"Katie Harris",annotation,student,"general feedback","Interesting to know the students perspective that general feedback is not so good, especially if they have done all the things mentioned. So in that case the students assignment should be of good quality.I was also of the belief that you should provide students with a mark or feedback, it is not necessary to give both."
00:03:33,"Katie Harris",annotation,student,"peer review","This sounds like a good way of incorporating peer review into the course. i.e. by marking a poster or presentation that other students have done."
----,"Katie Harris",comment,student,"Personalised feedback","The reoccurring message from this video was that students want personalised feedback from the lecturer. This is the most time consuming type of feedback to give to the student, rather than general feedback or peer review. These concepts also seemed to have less value to the students. So this is a good message to take away that the students want and benefit most from personalised feedback."
00:01:47,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Personalised feedback","General feedback is ok, but students want personalised feedback"
00:02:24,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Feedback for improvement","Feedback should be given in such a way that the student understands how to improve what they've done."
00:02:58,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,Rubrics,"Students find rubrics useful"
----,"Heba Khamis",comment,student,"The more the merrier","The main take-home message is the more feedback, the better. Additionally:* Feedback should be constructive* Personalised feedback is better than general feedback* Rubrics are useful"
00:00:31,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"Constructive criticism","I believe this student provides a good overview and understanding of the purpose of feedback. I have found that this criteria works well in a design studio situation where you can also ask the student where they felt they could improve and where their work has done well. This can open a more informative and reflective conversation between the teacher and the student."
00:01:29,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"General feedback","General feedback given to the class as a whole can be a good way of summarising key mistakes or shortcomings that we identified with an assignment. It also permits the student to inform the lecturer/tutor of areas that were perhaps not clearly defined in the assignment handout."
00:02:23,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,"Staged feedback","I have found that dividing an assignment into several stages with lower grade percentage at the beginning culminating with a larger percentage at the conclusion allows students to learn from their mistakes and shortcomings. The final outcome has generally resulted with the students rising to the occasion."
----,"Gregory Martens",comment,student,feedback,"In a design studio environment we encourage feedback through personalised feedback and general feedback. Tutors with groups of 20 students are able to provide personalised 1 on 1 constructive criticism and areas for improvement. I also find a weekly 'peep talk' via moodle encourages and helps keep students focused on the assignment objectives and outcomes."
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,,"As a relatively new lecturer, I have not thought much about the feedback I give to students. I have left it up to students to approach me if they have questions on their progress, particularly in the case of assessments. Watching these videos, I now realize that students have much more sophisticated expectations of feedback from lecturers. They look for personalized, constructive feedback on their progress and clear guidelines on what they need to do to succeed."
