00:00:22,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,listening,"There is so much emphasis on reading,  writing, oral presentations and other forms of communication but almost no time is spent teaching listening skills- the world would be better off if we all listened more!"
00:02:34,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,tests,"Interesting idea that tests are about how well we teach and who we taught rather than how well the students do."
00:08:00,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,trust,"Seems the way to build trust between students/instructors and students/peers is to shut up and let the students talk more so they get used to being wrong in front of everyone and no longer care."
00:08:43,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"cant refelct on what you dont see","That's interesting- you cant reflect on what you cant see- we are all blind to our own faults."
----,"Toni Ferrara",comment,student,,"The main points that stuck with me are that listening is a vital skill we rarely use, instructors should talk less and let their students talk more to encourage trust and really understand what students are having trouble with and that we typically cannot see our own flaws so having another instructor comment on what we do is very important."
00:01:37,"Haydn Washington",annotation,student,,"problem of too much face and not enough time on his diagrams!i like the idea of student as teachermindset of how you teach are more impt than strategies they useteachers as change agents vs facilitative teacherwish I could see the damn chart more!feedback works powerfully when you dont knowits a worry that feedback is uncommonpassion requires more time invested - problem for sessional lecturer!we need classrooms where error is welcomed - questionsonly way reflective teaching works if if you have evidence on what is really happeningwe dont confront what really matters - finding out if class learned"
----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,,"I like the idea of 'student as teacher'mindset of how you teach are more impt than strategies they use. The video however poorly explained the issue of teachers as change agents vs facilitative teachers. Needed more video time on his diagrams and less on his face! He notes its a worry that feedback is uncommon but he also notes that passion requires more time invested - problem for sessional lecturer! I agree that we need classrooms where error is welcomed - ie you get questions. However its a bit like the statement that we learn from our mistakes - when most of us deny we make any! Given my interest in change agency, would be good to know more re his preference for facilitative teachers."
00:02:31,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,"Using assessment as evaluation of your own teaching","I like the idea of using assessment as a way of evaluating your teaching"
00:07:41,"Melinda Chylinski",annotation,student,,"I agree with his comments about students feeling comfortable about answering questions even they are wrong."
----,"Melinda Chylinski",comment,student,,"I agree with Haydn, Having the mindset of how we teach is more important than the techniques used will definitely improve your teaching practice. And having a classroom where students feel comfortable about answering questions will befit both the teacher and the students."
00:01:52,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,Evaluation,"Interesting concept of evaluating and not just instructing. More of a journey of discovery than a ""I tell you so""."
00:07:40,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,Challenge,"I like the idea that the students should be challenged and not just go through the motions to get through the curriculum. Taking them out of their comfort zone and allowing for them to get it wrong sometimes in order to get it right later on. That teaches them critical thinking skills and problem solving techniques."
00:01:39,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","I like the phrase 'hear how students are learning' , but as a teacher to us he has conveyed this in an aggressive and condescending manner......the exact method he is trying to eradicate from his profession. Do as I say, not as I do????"
00:02:30,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","'what did you teach well to who' this is the great unknown unless you do an individual assessment, or have evaluations that aren't de-identified"
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,"Challenge and adapt","I think the important issues here is to find a style that you are comfortable with but also be flexible enough to evolve according to the situation. Challenging yourself and the students will add to create a positive learning experience and increase engagement. Bringing the right mindset and approach to class as well as looking for ways to develop other skills than just ramming through the course content will add to the overall enjoyment of the course and better equip the student for the workplace."
00:02:51,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","I like the phrase 'don't blame the kids/students'. I completely agree that the teacher, not the student is responsible for ensuring the learning objectives are met by the learning activities. This should be demonstrated by success in the assessment and reflection"
00:03:00,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","'Give the students different not more'. Teachers need to reflect on their methods if the students are not succeeding, not just give the student more of the same poor teaching."
----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","There was such irony in this presentation. The presentation style of this lecturer was the antithesis of the content he was delivering. Moving beyond that important messages I did take home were that it's not the students who need to improve their learning abilities, but the teachers, who need to diversify their methods and reflect on the outcomes the students have achieved, then modify/change accordingly."
00:02:29,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,,"I like his idea about the purpose of the tests (i.e., mainly to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching) as long as it can also meet the objective of testing the student on the appropriate scale."
----,"Bram Hoex",comment,student,,"The take-home message for me was to see the teacher as an evaluator and that the mindset of the teacher is very important. Some parts of the his presentation were, unfortunately, not very clear e.g. in the activator/facilitator part. I agree that challenging the students works very well, however, it obviously requires more preparation time and, preferentially, a high level of trust between the students and the teacher."
00:01:20,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I quite like the concept of &amp;amp;lsquo;teachers who are welcoming error and build trust&amp;amp;rsquo;. I fear that teachers too often roll their eyes when students get something wrong during, for example, seminar discussions. This is inappropriate because seminar discussions are meant to be identifying problems and clarifying things. Students who make errors, actively contribute to the discussion (i.e., they express their opinion about the matter), which should facilitate in-depth discussion of the matter."
00:02:28,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I find the concept ""Tests are about what did you teach well to whom"" remarkable. I guess, this is true if we assume that students want to learn and want to make the best out of a course. However, this statement is certainly invalid if the students do not care about the subject for whatever reason."
00:07:42,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I like the ideas that true/honest feed-back cannot be expected without building trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;errors in classroom should be tolerated&rdquo;. Seminar discussions and lectures should help students understand the basic concepts, and errors are necessarily occurring during the learning process. They are helpful for the teacher as well because they reveal weak points in the students&rsquo; understanding and pinpoint areas that require a more thorough discussion."
00:03:01,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"&amp;ldquo;Give the kids different rather than more.&amp;rdquo; I agree that it is very important to make sure that the students are not stuffed with unnecessary information. However, important information should be reiterated and should be emphasised in all possible contexts."
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"The most important messages of the lecture, at least for me, are (1) error should be welcomed in the classroom, (2) tests are about what I did teach well to whom, (3) give the kids different rather than more, and (4) honest feedback necessitates trust."
00:02:14,"Belinda Edwards",annotation,student,,"Teachers as evaluators of their own performance"
00:04:00,"Belinda Edwards",annotation,student,,huh?
00:06:09,"Belinda Edwards",annotation,student,,"setting the level of challenge"
00:02:15,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Students are the best evaluators of how well the classroom functions"
00:03:01,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"I feel uncomfortable about how he keeps referring to students as 'kids'"
00:05:35,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"I find the that student's don't always know what 'feedback' is"
00:06:32,"Jessica Ford",annotation,student,,"Trust is a huge issue in the arts and humanities, students need to feel safe to be wrong and feel safe to express ideas that are not fully formed"
00:02:26,"Maria Nawaz",annotation,student,,"Interesting that when you give an assessement in the classroom, it's about how well you taught."
00:04:50,"Maria Nawaz",annotation,student,,"Interesting that he talks about attitude being so important. I'm not sure that this comes through in his style of delivery."
00:06:27,"Maria Nawaz",annotation,student,,"I think the idea of building trust so students feel comfortable they say that they don't know is crucial."
00:08:04,"Maria Nawaz",annotation,student,,"Message of how you can teach better is an important concept - rather than focusing on data, we need to actively seek feedback to improve our teaching."
----,"Maria Nawaz",comment,student,,"I think this video provided some interesting approaches, especially through focusing on the mindset of teaching, and making learning visible to the teacher. I think it is important to build trust between the teacher and students so they feel comfortable asking questions and providing feedback."
00:03:29,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,"Teachers as change agents?!","Good grief. I have absolutely no idea what this slide is about."
00:03:54,"Shane Keating",annotation,student,"The Contrasts","Bit of a false dichotomy here. Why can't a teacher be passionate about their subject and provider discovery-based activities? And why is there a creepy picture of a naked child on this slide?"
00:02:52,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"This is critical message that mindset is more important than contents or strategies. I sometimes tend to blame students when they give poor results (I do not say so to students, but I often think so). I should be conscious of my mindset!"
00:04:20,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",annotation,student,,"I&rsquo;m not quite sure which is better from this video, activator or facilitator?"
----,"Hidehiro Yonezawa",comment,student,,"I agree that teacher&rsquo;s mindset and attitudes are important. I have reflected my attitudes and mindset and I found that I sometimes blame students, not my teaching! Facilitator and activator have both merits and demerits, I&rsquo;m not sure which is better. In relation to the mindset, activator may be better but I&rsquo;m not fully convinced."
----,"Shane Keating",comment,student,"This guy is a teacher?","Teachers play many roles, and one of them is as an evaluator of student learning and the teacher's own practice. But teachers must also be effective communicators. It doesn't matter if your teaching style is ""active"", ""facilitative"", or somewhere in between: if you cannot communicate clearly, I don't really see how you can be effective as a teacher. In this presentation, I counted 10-12 slides in just under 11 minutes. One of the slides had 18 bullet points. Every slide was festooned with jargon and irrelevant clip art. Most of it was totally disconnected with what Hattie was saying, and there was no ""story"" or central narrative. Obviously, this was a presentation in front of peers rather than a classroom situation. But I would argue that the same basic mechanics of communication are equally important in both environments. In University, students are transitioning from being ""kids"" (as Hattie insists on calling them) to adults --- adults with agency, self-motivation, and the ability to self-reflect. Perhaps in primary school, teachers need to be evaluators and students need to be teachers. But at University level, students must be able to evaluate their own learning. And lecturers need (at a minimum) to be able to lecture!"
----,"Pichamon Yeophantong",comment,student,,"Totally agree with his statement that 'classrooms where errors are tolerated are the ones where learning occurs'. Teachers should not aim at creating 'perfect' students, but rather holistic learners who are not afraid to speak out, be critical, and at times, be wrong!"
00:10:13,"Pichamon Yeophantong",annotation,student,,"Good point."
00:02:48,"Pichamon Yeophantong",annotation,student,,"Teachers as 'change agents' -- nice concept."
00:01:18,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,Evaluating,"I like the idea that tests are for you, as a teacher, to find out how well you went, who you thought well and who you didn&rsquo;t teach well and what did you teach well to whom. Having this mindset will lead to much greater effects."
00:05:01,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,"Challenging /Feedback","Teachers need to make tasks challenging for kids rather than just cover the curriculum."
00:06:26,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",annotation,student,"Classroom relationship","Teachers need to build trust with students to allow the students to express what they really think, say when they don&rsquo;t know or understand, and discuss errors."
----,"Gila Moalem-Taylor",comment,student,,"Despite some unclear parts during his talk, there are several important messages including the importance of the teacher&rsquo;s mindset and attitude, the role of tests for the teacher evaluation, providing feedback and building trust with students to allow learning from errors."
00:00:39,"Lopamudra Parekh",annotation,student,,"Listening is important for teachers to assess how students are learning"
00:01:11,"Lopamudra Parekh",annotation,student,,"Agree with ""Self regulation"", when student become their own teachers, however wonder to what level &amp; extent could that be applied in the discipline of interior architecture techniques course"
----,"Lopamudra Parekh",comment,student,,"I agree with the discussed teaching approaches - having an evaluater mindset, building trust with students, welcome &amp; tolerate mistakes, collect evidence and reflect upon it. Activator vs facilitator slide wasn't explained clearly though."
----,"Marcus De Leeuw",comment,student,,"I would love to see a video in which students tell us about their mind-set, their self-evaluation, their idea of what 'engagement' means etc etc - I would learn a lot from that probably! A lecturer's mind-set is important, if you are engaged and excited about the topics you teach students are easier convinced it is also interesting for them. The 'feedback-theory'/ 'need for trust' etc is what I found most interesting."
00:02:28,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"I always thought that ultimately if a student fails a test, or doesn't score well, this fact also means that my teaching strategies with that particular student haven't worked!"
00:06:26,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"Building trust","So true that they need to trust teacher and fellow students. Highlights importance of investing time in this area - challenging in larger classes.."
00:07:54,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"Teachers as evaluators","The continual learning circle - how can I do it better. Brings around the other ideas of mindset/attitude and listening"
00:07:35,"Kaye Chan",annotation,student,"error tolerated/welcome","This is so true but emphasises the need for trust so that the students can make errors and feel safe amongst peers etc"
----,"Kaye Chan",comment,student,"evaluator mindset","Overall, this speaks about our need to seek feedback, give feedback and be reflective. Creating a learning environment where students are there own teachers and feel safe to make mistakes and learn."
00:02:25,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"I think evaluating tests to see what areas were well understood and what areas students had trouble with is really important. It can definitely tell you what areas you need to improve and focus more thoroughly."
00:06:25,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,trust,"Trust is the foundation in building and maintaining successful relationships: business, personal, family, students."
00:00:53,"Katie Harris",annotation,student,,"Students being their own teachers is a good point of view. Sometimes students just want to be spoon fed, so for them to understand that they should be proactive and that they can learn things themselves is a good way of thinking."
00:02:31,"Katie Harris",annotation,student,,"It is quite a different way of thinking to say that the tests given to students are a way of evaluating your own teaching. In some aspects this may be accurate, but not always............."
00:04:34,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"Is he saying a facilitator teacher is better than an activator teacher? I think you have to be a bit of both and depending on the subject you are teaching you might be bit more of the one than the other."
00:02:33,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,tests,"I prefer to use the term quiz rather than test. I find the term quiz more engaging for students and allows for discussion."
00:05:38,"Katie Harris",annotation,student,Feedback,"I agree that students should be given clear feedback after they have undertaken a task / assessment / assignment. This is more work for the teacher to give individual feedback but is an important part of the students understanding. Perhaps a general / overall feedback tool would be good which incorporates parts of different students work. Then in the cases where a students has done well they may not have needed individual feedback but learning different aspects of what the teacher is looking for may benefit them. For the students who have not done so well then specific aspects of feedback will be useful ."
00:04:03,"Gregory Martens",annotation,student,,"Don't they support each other?"
00:07:07,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Building the trust - classrooms where error is welcomed","This is a great concept - but how do we build the trust?"
----,"Katie Harris",comment,student,,"I like the idea of getting feedback for yourself (as a lecturer) and to have a mindset that should be flexible and have flexible teaching practice. A teacher collecting evidence about themselves is a good way of ensuring good teaching practice. I also agree with the notion of establishing a trust that allows students to ask and answer questions that might be wrong. This is definitely reflective of the teachers personality if they can get this rapport with the students."
00:05:16,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,Feedback,"What is feedback? Students don't always know that they are receiving feedback. A lot of the time, I feel I need to have a big neon sign that says I am providing feedback."
00:03:00,"Heba Khamis",annotation,student,"Different not more","This is a good point - for example, if students aren't understanding a concept, find a way to present it differently, don't just do more of the same."
----,"Heba Khamis",comment,student,,"Some points that I have taken away from this video:* Use assessments to understand how well your teaching is working. If it's not deliver the content differently, don't just deliver more of the same.* Make sure students understand that they are receiving feedback and that they understand the feedback - and do this regularly.* Build trust to create a classroom where error is welcomed - but how do we build that trust?"
----,"Gregory Martens",comment,student,trust,"The number one message for me is trust. Whether it be with a client, colleague, student, family, partner once trust has been established healthy relationships are developed and maintained where everyone teaches and learns from each other. We all have different skills and levels of knowledge and sharing this information helps everybody."
00:01:28,"Sara Mesgari Hagh",annotation,student,assessment,"use assessment as an evaluation for your teaching"
----,"Abner Weng Cheong Poon",comment,student,null,"I like the feedback and trust elements in class that he talked about in his lecture."
00:02:34,"Kavitha Suthanthiraraj",annotation,student,null,"I like the concept of teachers as change agents!"
----,"Kavitha Suthanthiraraj",comment,student,null,"I like the concepts of the teacher being a 'change agent' and the teacher as an evaluator. I also agree with his advise on gaining effective feedback, evaluating this feedback in a trsuting environment and improving based on this feedback. Interesting presentation!"
