----,"Corey Martin",comment,student,"General comment","The key ideas for my own teaching from the video are:1. Ensuring that what we teach now is relevant (to students and societies lives) and useful for the future whether it be the actual content or more importantly the process of learning;2. We need to be cautious of what material we include and more importantly exclude from a course;3. Teaching of material can be meaningless and a waste of time, thus it is important to review the relevance of material presented in a course;4. Beware of curriculum and administration as barriers to learning and teaching."
00:00:27,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"What's worth learning","What's worth learning. The question can be posed on two levels: (1) problem-solving skills versus knowledge of facts and (2) what to include in the curriculum."
00:01:02,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Learning for the unkown","following on from the previous annotation: David is talking about learning problem solving skills rather than knowledge. I think the curriculum question is nevertheless equally important."
00:01:12,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"90% waste of time","That may be true when viewed across once entire learning (at school, university, ..) but not necessarily for particular courses. Discsipline-specific knowledge is still required in many professions."
----,"Till Boecking",comment,student,"David Perkins Interview","Key ideas for my teaching:- consider your student group and why they are taking this class (what is relevant to them)- facilitate deep learning through choise of relevant content to equip students with a way of thinking/problem solving above and beyond the actual content"

00:02:31,"Kelly Royds",annotation,student,,"Curriculum is one of the most resistant fronts of education - I can relate!"
----,"Kelly Royds",comment,student,,"If we accept the idea that 90% of what we teach is irrelevant for most students, then why do we continue to teach in such ways? What creates the resistance to change and innovation in learning? Is it the same across learning levels? For example, there are striking examples of early childcare education that embody child-centred learning to the point where curriculum/activities are designed after teachers have met the children..."

00:01:57,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,Claudio,"Teaching for understanding of wide scope"
----,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",comment,student,Claudio,"From this video I get two main ideas that I would like to apply to my teaching. First, is to teach for understanding the 'unknown'. This may sound a bit abstract but in fact it refers to a possible form of 'deep understanding'. If your students are able to come up with some new content that you did not explicitly mention during your lectures, but which somehow logically results from what you commented, is because they are not thinking superficially (which I think is great!). And second, is to teach while having in mind 'wider scopes'. In my opinion, this is related to the ability of turning learning into a functional skill. We go to university and specialize in very specific fields; however, when out of the academic environment we still need to solve problems, understand complicate relations, anticipate reactions, etc. In some way, both notes that I have taken are intimately related to the concept of how to promote a 'deep' understanding."
00:00:35,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,,
00:00:59,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,Omar,"Educating for the unknown --&gt; good point but for that to happen first you need to know the known first. Similar to vulnerability and resilience in Risk management. You want to develop resilience (unknowns) but for you to achieve that you need to first have a good system that reduces vulnerability (from known events)."
00:02:12,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,Omar,"this can be done if the subject is not a core one."
00:02:13,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,Omar,"Good point being made here and which relates to the discussion yesterday in FULT of moving from Surface to deep learning. I do that in my teaching where students are taught the concepts but the assignment given is a practical one in which they need to apply the knowledge learned to propose a solution."
00:02:28,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,OMar,"Very good point and David mentions it is a very challenging point. How can that be addressed? Want to know more!"
----,"Omar Hussain",comment,student,,"My summary after watching the video is:1. My key question would be how to make the curriculum of my course (that is very important in day to day activities) so that it is broad and not just explains the details?2. Most of my students are encouraged to do deep learning by using their assignments. Put in to practice what they have learned in the class in the assignments. Students who do deep learning are able to demonstrate their ability to solve some real world problems. 3. Case studies in tutorials. Assignments etc."

00:02:01,"Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe",annotation,student,,"teaching contents that gives understanding of a wide scope"
----,"Takuya Kojima",comment,student,Takuya,"a. What is more important than learning the contents for exams is learning how to contextualise the knowledge and apply it to various situations.b. They explore more expressions in their own context. They can build more expressions on what they have learnt for their own communication purpose in classrooms and outside classrooms.c. Knowledge is presented in a way that students can make it relevant to their own life and other disciplines."
00:00:41,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I agree. There are important global issues in the world today that could be translated into a totally new university curriculum altogether from the fairly traditional subjects that are still being taught every year. We need to keep up to speed with the world's pressing issues."
00:01:28,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I don't agree with this completely. In courses such as the ones pertaining to Media Studies (which I teach) there are a lot of important concepts, theories and practical examples that are being taught to students. And these are accompanied by relevant and engaging type of assignments, which are industry-related. What is often missing, however, are some of the new angles that the industry is taking. The media industry is changing so fast and so much, that is hard to stay up to date even for lecturers. Students are often more knowledgeable than us when it comes to certain media practices, and they loose their interest when they see these are not (yet) incorporated in the discussion."
00:02:08,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"This is a key challenge in our teaching practice, and one that we must prepare for. We are often constrained by a course structure that is already in place (and has been for a number of years perhaps) and, personally, I am not sure whether and how I should step out of it."
----,"Valentina Bau",comment,student,,"I believe that the university curriculum should stay abreast of contemporary global issues that go behind the traditional frameworks we are used to apply to university courses.If teaching is connected to both a theoretical and practical discussion that students can regard as relevant to their present and future daily lives, a deep approach to learning will occur naturally."
