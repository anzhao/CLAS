----,"Siyi Chen",comment,student,,"This video explained how to encode sets of symbols.We need to encode symbols as 24 bits, with 2 bits of code (ADD 00, MUL 10, SUB 01, DIV 11), 8 bits of operand 1,  8 bits of operand 2 and 6 bits all zeros."

----,"Wing Kiu Ng",comment,student,,"The video describes the method for encoding symbols. What determine this type of encoding include the number of bits and the corresponding symbols. The number of bits is related to the number of combinations. For example if there are 8 combinations, 3 bits are needed since 8 = 2^3. The bits are represented by the power of base 2.UAL- 1 is another way for encoding symbols. It is determined by three parts: the code, operand 1 and operand 2. The code consists of (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) while both operands can have any number between 0 and 255."
----,"Brendan Allan March",comment,student,,"This video describes how to encode a set of symbols.1) Choose no. of bits (n) to encode set symbols with, using the formula 2^n &gt;= |Set|.2) Describe how the symbols are going to be encoded [ie: how to interpret the string of n bits].The video then gives an example of this process."

----,"Luke Turner",comment,student,,"This video describes how to encode sets of symbols in binary.This is achieved by following the two steps:1) Define how many bits are to be used2) Create a set of correspondence between the symbols and the binary encodingE.g., common protocols for character encoding are ASCII and UNICODE, using various amounts of bitsThe UAL -1 system was defined as having 24 bits, and includes certain rules, such as different binary codes for ADD,SUB,MUL and DIV, and that the two operands must be between 1 and 255."

----,"Alexander Samuel Voitin",comment,student,encoding,"How to encode symbols in binary:1. choose how many bits you need to represent the set of symbols.2. choose a correspondence between each symbol and a binary string"
----,"Shing Him Ho",comment,student,,"This video explained how computers generally encode symbols with the ual-1 encoding scheme as an example. There are two steps to do the encoding: Identify the bits needed to represent the symbol and find a binary correspondence.For example, in order to encode the 4 symbols (add,sub,mul,div)We can use 2 bits for the symbolsthen corresponding them with 4 combinations (00,01,10,11)"
----,"Vugar Aghayev",comment,student,,"Important aspects:When encoding characters look for: 1. how many bits to use2. correspondence between the symbols in binary encoding. The video talks about ASCII and Unicode Then the UAL-1 system is explained, where we can just invent encoding"
