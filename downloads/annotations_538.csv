----,"Wing Kiu Ng",comment,student,,"The video describes the method for encoding symbols. What determine this type of encoding include the number of bits and the corresponding symbols. The number of bits is related to the number of combinations. For example if there are 8 combinations, 3 bits are needed since 8 = 2^3. The bits are represented by the power of base 2.UAL- 1 is another way for encoding symbols. It is determined by three parts: the code, operand 1 and operand 2. The code consists of (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV) while both operands can have any number between 0 and 255."

----,"Francisco Esteban Acosta Arroyo",comment,student,,"In this video is shown the techniques that computers use to encode sets of symbols, and this is by following 2 steps:1. Choosing how many bits will be used when encoding:  This consists by making sure that the   number of bits is greater than the  number if elements on the set.2. Defining a Correspondence between Symbols and the Binary Encoding: This works by choosing a combination of  0s and 1s when they are single elements, or for characters there's types of encoding such as ASCII &amp;amp; UNICODE.Another example is the example with UAL-1 shown that includes words with 3 elements (CODE, OPERAND 1, OPERAND 2) CODE: consists of Add, Sub, Mul, Div. It encodes 4 bits OPERAND 1: consists of any number from 0 to 255. It will encode 256 bits OPERAND 2: consists of any number from 0 to 255. It will encode 256 bitswhich at the end it will allow us encode at least 18 bits (2^18)e.g. ADD 53 28 == 000011010100011100000000with filler bits as it has been said that we will need bigger bits storing the set"

----,"Shanaye Appiah",comment,student,Summary,"- To encode a set of symbols you need two things:1. To choose how many bits to represent it in by calculating the total number of bits you need2. To define a correspondence table which sets out the symbols and their equivalent binary representation. Your correspondence also decides how many bits to allocate to each symbol- There are different types of encoding1. 8 bit ASCII which isn't able to represent as many symbols2. Unicode, which represents symbols for languages all over the world. It comes in 8, 16 and 21 bit variants (UTF)- You must transmit the decided number of bits, even if it is more than you get from encoding. The extra bits are filler bits- Usually longs strings are put into hexadecimal for simplicity"
