----,"Daniel Alexander Garzaniti",comment,student,,"There are three types of flip flops, these include SR, JK and D.The transition table for the flip flop specifies  the value of the output at the next raising edge of the clock.Outputs remain constant at all other times other then the raising edge."

----,"Madeline Frances Kim Pham",comment,student,Summary,"There are three main types of flip-flops: SR, JK and D1). SR flip-flops:three inputs: S, R and raising edge clocktwo outputs: Q and Q'Q and Q' are always opposite valueconsider S as 'set' and R as 'reset' when filling out transition tableavoid the combination 1 12). JK flip-flops:three inputs: S, R and raising edge clocktwo outputs: Q and Q'same transition table as SR flip-flop, only the combination 1 1 results in Q(t)'3) D flip-flops:two inputs: D and raising edge clocktwo outputs: Q and Q'inputs = outputs-all transition tables show the value of the output at the next raising edge of the clock"

00:02:43,"Brendan Allan March",annotation,student,,"The transition of when S &amp; R both equal 1 during a rising edge of the clock should be avoided, as the outcome Q cannot be predicted."

00:05:11,"Brendan Allan March",annotation,student,,"This section describes how best to remember the criteria for what to write in the output column of the transition table."
----,"Brendan Allan March",comment,student,,"This video describes Flip-Flops; in particular: SR, JK and D Flip-Flops.An SR Flip-Flop accepts 3 inputs: S, R and a 'rising-edge' clock. It also has 2 outputs: Q and Q-bar (Q-bar being the opposite of Q at all times).The output values of a Flip-Flop changes according to the input values at the times when the clock signifies a 'rising-edge'. At all other times, the signal remains constant.The Transition Table of an SR Flip-Flop is as follows:S R | Q(t)----|-----0 0 | Q(t-1)0 1 | 01 0 | 11 1 | ?When (S, R) = (1, 1), the value of Q cannot be predicted, and therefore this situation should be avoided.There are 2 more Flip-Flops described in this video: JK and D Flip-Flops. The transition tables for each are as follows:J K | Q(t)----|-----0 0 | Q(t)0 1 | 01 0 | 11 1 | Q(t)-barD | Q(t)--|-----0 | 01 | 1As you can see, when the JK Flip-Flop has inputs (1, 1), the values of its outputs are reversed.Additionally, the D Flip-Flop features only one input."

----,"Guilherme Barbosa Leme",comment,student,,"In this lecture we learned the three types of flip flops: SR, JK and D.It shows us how each of them works, the differences between them and the output behavior based on an analysis of the output table for each possible case."
----,"Jimmy Photirath",comment,student,Summary,"Summary of the behaviour of SR, JK and D flip flops1.	SR Flip flops-	Three inputs of S, R and raising edge clock-	Two outputs of Q and Q&rsquo;-	S is set and R is reset when filling out the transition table2.	JK flip flops-	Three inputs of S, R and raising edge clock-	Two outputs of Q and Q&rsquo;-	It has the same transition table as SR flip flop but the combination 1 1 results in Q(t)&rsquo;3.	D flip flops-	Two inputs of D and raising edge clock-	Two outputs of Q and Q&rsquo;-	Inputs = outputsAll transition tables show the value of the output at the next raising edge of the clock."
