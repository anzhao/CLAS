00:00:11,"Ginu Rajan",annotation,student,,"Flipped classroom- I started hearing this word quite recently, but I used to record my lectures in advanced and give to my students, if I have some other engagements such as conferences etc. And when I am back we used to have a brief discussion about the lecture to clarify the doubts etc. In this way I managed my lectures without any cancellation and also managed to attend meetings and conferences round through the year."
00:01:40,"Ginu Rajan",annotation,student,,"Normally in standard class room teaching, students just turn-up without any idea of what being in the lecture. But in flipped classroom approach, it is necessary that the students should watch the video before the class. So the question is how effective is this?, and how practical it is. In my opinion at least 50% might turn up without watching. In such a scenario, how can we make the teaching effective"
00:02:23,"Ginu Rajan",annotation,student,,"I agree that the recorded lectures will be useful for the students close to the exams, as it is easy for them to review the contents and listen to lectures again.But again coming to my previous concern on how can we make the students to complete the prerequisites, and make them actively participate in the class room activities.Again, does this make some students more beneficial, those found time to watch the video?"
00:02:47,"Ginu Rajan",annotation,student,,"I agree that this approach helps to make the class room activities more interesting, improve the student-lecturer relation etc."
00:01:14,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I'm most convinced by the argument that many students will learn the content of a lecture better (and deeper) if they have the option to start and stop a lecture recording as required, rather than having to try to keep up while sitting in a lecture theatre!"
00:01:46,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of starting each lecture with an open quiz to get people engaged and ready for the session!"
00:02:00,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"As a lecturer in a big course, who doesn't run any tutorials myself, I'm very much attracted to the option of getting more direct connections with a greater number of students, through the flipped classroom model."
00:02:36,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Great ideas about how to share responses - by identifying those groups most likely to be most interesting/different and actively asking them to share, you avoid the issue of students being unwilling to share their ideas in case they look silly."
00:03:35,"Christy Newman",annotation,student,,"Amazing to think of all the possibilities afforded by recording group activities in lecture sessions, so students can access them later!"
----,"Christy Newman",comment,student,,"I've heard a little about flipped classrooms before, but this video has given me lots of concrete ideas about what is possible through this approach, I really like it! It's a bit daunting to think about the work required to set it up, recording the (short) videos beforehand, for example, but the benefits for student learning are clear, and I think the students I teach would really love it. Lots of things for me to think about now in terms of restructuring my course for next year..."
00:01:27,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"Cutting down","It's interesting to hear that the traditional lecture was cut down from 50 mins to 12-15 mins. What content was cut out? Was this content used during the flipped classroom time?"
00:02:03,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,"Lecture theatre design","It's interesting to see that although the flipped classroom is being used, the room itself is not equipped to handle the group work. What sort of things can lecturers do to make the most of the current spaces provided for giving lectures?"
00:03:02,"Lincoln Gomes",annotation,student,filming,"I like the idea of getting students to contribute their ideas to the rest of the cohort, but what about considerations for students who would like to contribute but are not necessarily comfortable being filmed? It makes me think of what I could do to get the quieter ones more involved in class discussion, whilst not making them feel like they are being isolated for being quiet."
----,"Lincoln Gomes",comment,student,"flipped classroom","The flipped classroom is certainly more dynamic. Having been a student in one course that employs it, it does force you to think much more critically about the content. I would still like to know about more ways to include quieter students in discussion without making them feel isolated. ie. how can the flipped classroom be made more inclusive rather than just providing an outlet for the most vocal students?"
00:00:19,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Right off the bat, I am not sure how relevant this is to my current teaching practice, as I only teach small groups (usually around 20-30 students, at any rate capped at 44). But I've taught big lectures in the past, so, we'll see."
00:01:02,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"Yes, the lecture time is cut down, but I would think part of the ""efficiency"" is because there is no time for discussions anymore.And maybe it's a lack of student conditioning for this model, but, in my flipped classroom experience, students who do not understand a concept in the video are unlikely to make a note of the question and bring it to class for discussion.I don't know, I think I'm too much of a control freak to assume that any questions a student might have will resolve themselves inside the small group, during the activity."
00:01:53,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of adding a timer to the screen, I don't know why I hadn't done that before."
00:03:03,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"So, what is the rest of the class supposed to do while the few students are recording their videos? I missed that step."
----,"Lucas Lixinski",comment,student,,"It's certainly an interesting approach to flipped classrooms. We have been experimenting with some of that at the Law Faculty, and I've been involved in some flipped classroom course design. We do things a bit differently, because our groups are quite a bit smaller, but I can see a lot of similarities, too.One thing that particularly struck me about the video is the notion that all student questions can be answered if the student is able to slow down and rewind the video. From my experience, very often the information just needs to be conveyed in a different way, and, while the classroom might be an opportunity to do just that, the video didn't seem to convey there would be much space for group discussion of issues raised in the videos, just individual consultations at the end of class."
00:00:41,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"It is a good idea that they actually do some work beforhand that would go with they are to do in the classroom"
00:01:29,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"I always thought that optimizing the pace of my talks was the most difficult task when delivering a lecture! I like the idea that the talks are reproducible!"
00:02:39,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"this is infact more work than usual delivery of a lecture but it is less likely to have dead-fish faces in this type of teaching in the classroom!"
00:03:42,"Apo Demirkol",annotation,student,,"i think it is plausible that they can develop more instructive relationships with their instructor"
----,"Apo Demirkol",comment,student,,"I think this could be viable in my teaching but I am aware of the fact that it is a lot of work! For a conjoint, it is a daunting thought!"
00:00:52,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"It sounds good in theory. But there are some issues. First, organising 200+ students into groups each lecture is a pretty big logistical challenge for just one lecturer. A lot of time can be lost just getting things arrange. Second, some classroom (lecture theatre) layouts aren't that conducive for group work (i.e., they have been designed for lecture formats); and third,we need to take into account how this approach might affect SEADU students"
00:03:35,"Paul Munro",annotation,student,,"It would be interesting to see student feedback to gather their perspective on the approach. Also, I wonder if this approach is more conducive from some disciplines more than others."
----,"Paul Munro",comment,student,,"It seems like a really interesting approach, and I would like to experiment with it (perhaps try it out for one or two weeks next semester) before implementing it in full. I am wondering about tutorials? How do they link into this approach?"
00:00:45,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"That's an interesting concept using vidoes- It seems similar to what I have done in the past such as asking students to read a paper or watch a documentary before coming to a seminar or tutorial...only works when they actually do it though!!"
00:01:39,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"Ok- that's a good idea to ensure student's have actually watched the lecture. very interesting, I have never heard of this before!"
00:03:33,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"I'm actually really impressed by this. It's a really innovative strategy. I would be very interested to learn much more about this. I suppose there must be different in class activities that could be implemented. I would definitely like to explore what these would be."
00:03:38,"Jesse Cale",annotation,student,,"I guess one of my questions would be how feasible it is to make students complete a quiz each class. While I am all for this, in my experience at least here, I think the students would revolt! On the other hand, making each worth minimal marks might not be enough to ensure they all participate consistently which would then create some problems with the group work."

00:00:00,"Leonie Ligertwood",annotation,student,"Physical environment","I'd previously thought that a traditional lecture theatre would be antithetical to the implementation of the flipped classroom.  I was most impressed - he managed the learning process simply and effectively."
00:01:30,"Alishia Williams",annotation,student,,"12 min lectures?? Sounds good in theory, but probably a challenge to cover all content traditionally covered in a semester. But that raises the question of whether we try to cram in too much information."
00:02:46,"Alishia Williams",annotation,student,,"I'm pro technological aids - but from experience know that when we become too reliant upon them and the technology fails (video recording, link to upload etc) chaos can result."
00:00:00,"Sue Williamson",annotation,student,"watching videos","I like the idea of students watching a video and then doing group exercises in class. I could use this, as some of my material is quite dry. I've also made the videos, so am ready to go!"
----,"Sue Williamson",comment,student,,"This approach is very interesting. My students have commented that some of the material in my course is a little dry, so this would certainly help to make it more interesting. I've already done the videos too, which would help me. But then, I wonder about tutorials - how would tutorial activities be different?"
00:03:42,"Dianne Anagnos",annotation,student,,"A huge improvement to the lecture-style approach for large groups.  However it also seems quite resource- intensive for the teacher.  I teach much smaller groups where there is time for small-group work and for all students to present their work to the larger group and ask questions along the way, but this may still be worth exloring."
00:00:42,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"The lecture room looks unsuitable to group work"
00:01:26,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"Do lecturers get training on how to lecture to a video camera? Seems like a good idea"
00:03:28,"Mark Braidwood",annotation,student,,"What about introverts? Does this model apply better to extroverts?"
00:00:42,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,"lecture room","The business school has constructed a number of 'flipped classrooms'. Good to see that the 'traditional' space can be used in a flipped manner."
00:02:16,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,camera,"Neat use of common technology to capture group outcomes"
00:01:50,"Jeff Coulton",annotation,student,clock,"I've used the clock in exams, but it's a neat idea for groupwork as well"
----,"Jeff Coulton",comment,student,,"Some good examples of using a traditional space in a flipped way - ie we don't have to rely on specifically redesigned teaching spaces. Like the use of the phone camera and countdown."
00:03:42,"Thomas McConochie",annotation,student,,"This is the first flipped classroom I have seen in the form of a lecture. It looks like the lecture has become a large tutorial session. If that is the case, then what is the point of having ""lectures""?"
00:01:19,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"I can see a real benefit to student learning  through the flipped classroom model. The current course I teach does not upload the Lectures for obvious reasons however, the ability of students to stop rewind and go over content definitely can enhance student learning."
00:02:10,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"Creating the space for more one on one time with the students to see learning in action and to answer questions is certainly valuable for student engagement and deep learning."
00:03:42,"Julie Wilson",annotation,student,,"I like the interactive nature of the flipped classroom Model and the ability of the teacher to  spend more one on one time with students. I would be interested in student feedback and how different personalities felt participating."
00:01:37,"Josh Wodak",annotation,student,,"An interesting overview of flipped classroom but doesn't seem to be a good example of a type of physical classroom to 'flip' ie the steep tiered seating, inability to change seating direction and size of room don't seem conducive to forming groups for more interactive and participatory student engagement. Although, given most lecture theatures have this physical structure and its inherent limitations, maybe they used this example because it represents that type of rooms that flipped teaching is trying to take place within."
