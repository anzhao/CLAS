This forward thinking, anticipating needs and almost forecasting is very important. we need to teach our students to adapt to a dynamic environment, to be 'street smart' and to think creatively out of the box."
00:02:29,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I find the comment about curriculum design also very interesting since we cannot teach students to connect the dots between different courses and subject matter if the programs and products we offer is inflexible and narrowly put together. Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research needs to feed through to teaching as well. How to achieve this, however is another question."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,,"I found this a very interesting conversation. I will take away the following ideas: We need to prepare students for the unknown by including tools from different disciplines. This will enable them to draw on a wide knowledge base and utilise these tools in creative ways. Students also need to take responsibility of their personal learning journey."
