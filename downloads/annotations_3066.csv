00:00:51,"Heath Pratt",annotation,student,"More Than a Mark","This is an interesting comment and articulates the value of effective feedback, "" it is more than just the mark..."". A mark without ""why"" is useless and especially when the student has performed badly. Without positive or negative reinforcement the student can  not develop the complex mental models required to adapt and apply the knowledge gained."
00:00:30,"Heath Pratt",annotation,student,"Personal Nature of Feedback","It is interesting to reflect on the personal nature of feedback. It is very personal by nature, to be effective it must be, in that the student is revealing themselves and making themselves vulnerable in order for them to grow. Therefore, effective feedback must be constructive and meaningful."
00:01:41,"Heath Pratt",annotation,student,Feedback,"Once again reinforcing the value of timely and constructive feedback from the student perspective."
00:02:16,"Heath Pratt",annotation,student,"Have the Opportunity to Apply Feedback","I think this is a very important point, there is no value in feedback unless the student can reapply the positive or negative reinforcement to reaffirm the now adapted/changed mental models."
00:03:02,"Heath Pratt",annotation,student,"Goal Posts","The importance of establishing goal posts is very important from the students' perspective as it gives them something to aim for and correct if they don't achieve it the first time."
00:03:03,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I tend to use marking rubrics a lot. I indicate where the student's assignment falls in the scale for each criteria within the rubric, and then I give a final overall feedback where I might indicate more precisely the positive and negative aspects of the assignment.Yet, I find that some students are still not satisfied with that, especially where they were really convinced that they were going to get a much higher mark..."
00:01:29,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"After marking a large amount of assignments, there are instances in which you can clearly see some recurring issues that most students have. In that case, I tend to prepare a few PP slides and go through them at the lecture or tutorial before the assignments are turned. This way, I address the main problems to the whole class, and after that each student gets his/her individual feedback. I find this a useful approach for me."
----,"Valentina Bau",comment,student,,"The opinions collected in this video don't offer anything new to me other than what I had already learned through my experience:- give personalised feedback (no general)- use a marking rubric- be there to clarify your feedback to students if they don't understand it."
00:03:05,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,"Claudio Cazorla","Including rubrics in your assignments can make the students feel less insecure. It is necessary to make clear what and how you are evaluating a particular set of contents so that the final mark will make full sense."
00:05:00,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,"Claudio Cazorla","Feedback, it does not matter whether is done face to face or electronically, the important thing it has to be personalised."
----,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",comment,student,"Claudio Cazorla","Feedback should be understood as a constructive way of commenting on students work. It is important to point out to students where their work look strong or where they need to apply some tweaking. Ideally, one should always provide feedback along with marks, even in the case the classroom group is large. Including rubrics in your assignments can make the students feel less insecure. It is necessary to make clear what and how you are evaluating a particular set of contents so that the final mark makes full sense. Another important point is that feedback, does not matter whether is done face to face or electronically, should be personalised in order for the students to take full advantage."
00:01:05,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,,"Getting individualised feedback when part of a large cohort is challenging. It may require students to seek it out."

00:02:55,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,,"Detailed rubrics with weighted marks for questions are useful."
00:03:48,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,,"Peer feedback in conjunction with teacher feedback is useful."
----,"Sonia Graham",comment,student,,"Feedback is most useful when it is personalised and specific. While general feedback might be unavoidable with large class sizes, students may feel that it doesn't apply to them.Peer feedback is also seen to be useful, especially when used in conjunction with feedback from the teacher. This was good to hear given that I'm in the process of using peer feedback to provide more comprehensive feedback to students doing group presentations. The background material for this module on feedback made me realise that I didn't explain my approach to feedback to students, which would have been useful. E.g. I could have explained that for each of them there is one comment on the front page of their assignments (in grademark) that gives an overall summary of my feedback on their assignment and that the rest are more specific details throughout. This might explain why some students were unaware how they went because they didn't realise that they had to look for the overall feedback on the first page."
00:04:28,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Both ways","Feedback is required both ways, i.e. from the teacher to the students and from the students to the teacher."
----,"Till Boecking",comment,student,,"Students value meaningful feedback of their work to understand why a particular mark was awarded and how to improve their performance. This aspect ties in with rubrics that set out the criteria for marking. There should be recirpocal feedback between students and teachers and between peers."
00:05:09,"Saud Albaqami",annotation,student,,"It is pretty much depending on the nature of the subjects as well as the size of the class. This influences the assessment types and the design which are in turn enhance or hinder the effectiveness of the feedback."
----,"Saud Albaqami",comment,student,,"It is pretty much depending on the nature of the subjects as well as the size of the class. This influences the assessment types and the design which are in turn enhance or hinder the effectiveness of the feedback. Having said that it is consisted of two stages, the first is prior the assessment, the second is after the submission of the tasks. In the first stage, it is the responsibility of the course lecture and coordinator to set up the assessment type that is based on the context of the subjects. It should be clearly identified in details it in the course syllabus It is the assessment type which the feedback is based on whether it is group presentation, assignments, etc&hellip;. . This should be very well explained to students prior the task to make them aware of the requirements. In the second stage, the feedback is should be given in personal way weather it is online or face to face in the consultation time provided by the lectures."

00:03:05,"Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe",annotation,student,,"Rubrics are useful"
----,"Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe",comment,student,,"Students value feedback in their learning. As a marker, to provide feedback and mark to assignments using a rubric is very helpful . When there is no marking guidelines given, feedback can still be provided, but giving mark is difficult. Is ranking useful or important ?"
00:05:23,"Mariam Farida",annotation,student,feedback,"feedback is one of the things students tend to get anxious about and often students tell me how feedback affects them either positively or negatively throughout their learning process. i think marking rubrics are great ways to set up marking criteria but it should be tailored to every assignment specifically, where the student can know when to draw on theoretical approaches and when to use his/her own reflections..etc. also peer review assessments is great but i am not sure if it will be as beneficial to students as when they receive feedback from their teachers so that students will get some advises on how to improve, but i do agree its a great way to interact and less stressful for students. feedback is essential but it should not be perceived as the only tool to ""assess"" the student, and further activities and considerations should be put in place too."
00:00:32,"David Silvera Tawil",annotation,student,"Sugestions for improvement","For feedback to be effective it should provide suggestions for improvement. Just a statement on how good/bad the work is does not help students grow and develop their skills."
00:01:38,"David Silvera Tawil",annotation,student,"General feedback","General feedback only provides limited suggestions. At least a line with personalised feedback to those who didn't performs similar to the group average would be beneficial."
00:03:01,"David Silvera Tawil",annotation,student,Rubrics,"Using rubrics is beneficial not only as a marker, but it helps students give their work. They know what the lecturer is looking for. It is important to leave the criteria relatively general to avoid recipe-like assignments."

00:00:58,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,"Omar Hussain","I manage a large class but I always give feedback + marks as just giving marks is not sufficient to let the student know where did he/she go wrong. I also use a marking rubric but that does not replace the feedback component."
00:01:53,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,"Omar Hussain","personalized feedback is important."
00:02:22,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,"Omar Hussain","I use that in my course. Assessment 2 is a short weighted one which has less mark and feedback is given to the students. They then take that into consideration when making the next essay (which is a continuation of the previous one) but of higher mark. By giving them feedback I expect the students to be more focused in this essay of theirs."

----,"Omar Hussain",comment,student,"Omar Hussain","Feedback is important as it is the avenue students get to know from the lecturer on how they have performed in the course. No matter how large the class is, feedback should be1. Personalized2. Consistent - marking rubric is important3. Constructive and should be continued i.e. assessment 2 should be built on assessment 1.

----,"Yue Huang",comment,student,feedback,"Personal feedback is more effective. However, it is difficult to do in a large cohort. From student perspective, constructive, suggestion, and personalised feedback would be useful. However, sometimes, the tutor would not remember every student's name in a group of 30+ after a few weeks tutorial. How to overcome this obstacle is not mentioned in the video and this will take a large amount of time and effort from lecturer perspective."

----,"Nicholas Richardson",comment,student,,"The more I teach the more I realise feedback needs to be built into the culture of a class. It is not just about informing a student or a cohort how they are tracking against expectations, it is as much about generating a dialogue which has all kinds of longer-term benefits in terms of student engagement and participation in class. It takes effort to listen carefully to every piece of group or individual work in class and then to give meaningful feedback on each particular piece but the effort involved in informal feedback pays off considerably - students become more comfortable engaging critically in class with the material. This boosts the learning (and teaching) experience for everyone."
