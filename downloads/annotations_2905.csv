00:00:59,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"Time efficiency","Making sure the students (and myself) are not spending twice as long on structured learning activities once a video is brought in is important."
00:01:28,"Penelope Uther",annotation,student,"Pace of lecture","Allowing review of the lecture is a great way of consolidating learning."
----,"Penelope Uther",comment,student,"Efficiency of flipped classroom","It is important to bear in mind any increase in workload for the teacher and the student- the pre-session work may only be a small portion (in time) of what it is replacing.  The flipped classroom has the ability to make sessions more individualised and tailored.  1 - Students can work through the presession activity at their own pace, and 2 - I can interact with small groups rather than a giant group."
00:03:07,"Kavitha Suthanthiraraj",annotation,student,null,"Interesting how technology is used pre lecture and through out the lecture to assist with the learning process and also enable greater reflection through recording feedback"
00:02:50,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"Would we need to get ethics approval before we can record students in a situation like this?"
----,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",comment,student,,"I personally see the flipped class room working well in a tutorial or a practical class rather than a lecture. The smaller number of students would make discussion aspects easier. Having a repository of student responses or ideas that are recorded is a great idea because showing that their contributions are useful or important in learning would make them feel more confident."
00:01:24,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Large amounts of pre-work for multiple sessions within a course may overburden students. If they don't complete the pre-work the quiz and group exercise would fail, and students may not attend the session."
00:01:33,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","For students with English as a second language being able to watch the lecture at their own pace would certainly help their disadvantage in absorbing a fast paced lecture."
00:02:11,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","Lecturer can more easily identify the exemplar student responses in the group task to present, and upskill the underperforming groups."
00:03:31,"Louise Baird",annotation,student,"Louise Baird","The session would be more memorable, and students can review later their own contemporaneous thoughts given during the lecture, which are recorded.The students will build relationships with each other and the lecturer"
----,"Louise Baird",comment,student,"Louise Baird","The flipped classroom model has obvious advantages -- students attend class with knowledge/skills already learned, and are tested on this with a quiz motivating them to do the pre-work. There is more interaction, both with each other and the lecturer which will raise the standard of the under performing students. Students can review live aspects of the lecturer afterwards from their own responses which will be memorable, and reflections more meaningful."

----,"Haydn Washington",comment,student,,"Flipped classroom using pre-recorded video lecture reduces lecture time by a quarter or a half. The open note quiz is done by students when the actual class starts - however not clear to me how it is carried out to assess students have watched and understood the video lecture?There are discussion questions in groups with responses of key groups recorded.Benefits claimed are that students can publish their own critical thoughts and can reflect on them.I do wonder about the loss of the immediacy of being able to ask a question immediately while a lecture is being given. Under the flipped system the student would have to write it down to ask later."
00:00:44,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"content of videos","I wonder what type of content is in this video. Hopefully it's engaging and interesting rather that a dry lecture."
00:01:23,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,video,"It's great the students can slow this down and review it at their own pace."
00:02:01,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"class interaction","I LOVE the idea of the lecturer speaking with individual groups and circulating throughout the classroom. In large classrooms it's so hard to interact with individual students."
00:02:51,"Toni Ferrara",annotation,student,"recroding students","I wonder how the students felt about being recorded."
----,"Toni Ferrara",comment,student,"Toni Ferrara","I can see the advantages of the flipped classroom approach and I love the idea of the lecturer being able to interact with individuals in a large classroom. I don't think the pre-recorded videos just have to be a lecturer presenting material they could instead include videos on topics as well, such as animations. One main issue however, is how will busy academics find time to build these resources. Many academics are currently judged largely on their research outputs with teaching considered something that you just do as part of your job description.  Until UNSW as an institution rewards quality teaching, making it a key aspect of the promotions process, few academics will be encouraged to put the effort into flipped classrooms that is required. UNSW needs to consider teaching only positions in order to optimize teaching and research outputs."
00:01:06,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I fail to see how the lecture time could be halved by (simply) pre-recording it. I find it difficult to believe that just because the lecture is pre-recorded and the speaker can talk as fast as he wishes, the duration of the entire lecture is halved. Something does not add up here for me."
00:01:31,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,": I think one of the benefits of live lectures is interaction. The speaker maintains contact with the class and responds if (s)he feels that a thought did not make sense to the audience. I do not very much like the idea that I could talk to a recorder instead, without any sort of speaker-audience interaction."
00:02:01,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"So, the technique effectively is that the lecture is converted to a multi-group seminar discussion. I am not sure that I see the benefit of this. What happens to the conventional seminar discussions in this setting?"
00:03:20,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Most speakers would take questions anyway at the end of the lecture. Alternatively, students could come forward with their problems during seminar discussions. Therefore, the claim that in this setting the speaker 'has time to take questions' is not a real benefit."
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"The main idea behind flipped classroom is that the lecturer pre-records the lecture (allegedly by cutting its duration to half of the &lsquo;live&rsquo; lecture), and then students can discuss the material in small groups. It is claimed that this way the students are more involved, and they can (and are willing to) express their ideas.I have no doubt that the flipped classroom technique may have benefits under certain circumstances. However, I am yet to be convinced that it can largely replace the more conventional lectures-seminar discussions axis. My concerns and doubts are the following: (1) I fail to see how the lecture time is halved by pre-recording it. (2) I think one of the benefits of live lectures is interaction. The speaker maintains contact with the class and responds if (s)he feels that a thought did not make sense to the audience. This crucial aspect of the conventional lectures is taken away. (3) My best memories of tertiary education are those of excellent lectures. A good lecture is exciting, engaging, thought-provoking, and enjoyable. These features would be mostly taken away by a YouTube presentation. (4) I do not like the idea that the lecture is converted to a humongous multi-group seminar discussion. To me, it seems largely ineffective, almost chaotic. (5) According to the presenter, one of the benefits of this teaching technique is that the speaker has time to take questions at the end of the lecture. I remain unconvinced that this is a real benefit because most speakers would take questions anyway at the end of the lecture. In addition, students have the chance to come forward with their problems during seminar discussions. This is what seminar discussions are for.I am curious what students think about this technique. Unfortunately, this is not explained in the demonstration video."
00:00:56,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,"Time saving","I do not understand how you can save 50-75% of lecture time by pre-recording."
00:03:29,"Bram Hoex",annotation,student,"Number of instructors","I am wondering if one would also increase the number of teaching staff during the F2F sessions, especially when the class size is very large."
----,"Bram Hoex",comment,student,"Flipped class room","In principle I like the concept of flipped class room as it allows the students to complete the lectures at their own pace (and they can view them again) and to make better use of the F2F sessions. A potential downside is, however, that you do not get direct feedback on the lecture from your students (e.g. if you are going too fast and loose your students early in the lecture). But in general I consider it a very good way to increase deep learning."
