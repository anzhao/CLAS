SR flip-flops:three inputs: S, R and raising edge clocktwo outputs: Q and Q'Q and Q' are always opposite valueconsider S as 'set' and R as 'reset' when filling out transition tableavoid the combination 1 12). JK flip-flops:three inputs: S, R and raising edge clocktwo outputs: Q and Q'same transition table as SR flip-flop, only the combination 1 1 results in Q(t)'3) D flip-flops:two inputs: D and raising edge clocktwo outputs: Q and Q'inputs = outputs-all transition tables show the value of the output at the next raising edge of the clock"

----,"Brendan Allan March",comment,student,,"This video describes Flip-Flops; in particular: SR, JK and D Flip-Flops.An SR Flip-Flop accepts 3 inputs: S, R and a 'rising-edge' clock. It also has 2 outputs: Q and Q-bar (Q-bar being the opposite of Q at all times).The output values of a Flip-Flop changes according to the input values at the times when the clock signifies a 'rising-edge'. At all other times, the signal remains constant.The Transition Table of an SR Flip-Flop is as follows:S R | Q(t)----|-----0 0 | Q(t-1)0 1 | 01 0 | 11 1 | ?When (S, R) = (1, 1), the value of Q cannot be predicted, and therefore this situation should be avoided.There are 2 more Flip-Flops described in this video: JK and D Flip-Flops. The transition tables for each are as follows:J K | Q(t)----|-----0 0 | Q(t)0 1 | 01 0 | 11 1 | Q(t)-barD | Q(t)--|-----0 | 01 | 1As you can see, when the JK Flip-Flop has inputs (1, 1), the values of its outputs are reversed.Additionally, the D Flip-Flop features only one input."

----,"Francisco Esteban Acosta Arroyo",comment,student,,"Summary:The video explains how SR, JK and D Flip-Hlops behave.There are 3 types of Flip-Flops that have 2 output values which can be symbolized Q and Q' which have opposite valuesThese type of Flip-Flops depend on the values of their inputs and when the clock makes a transition to a raising edge.1. S R Flip-Flop: The outputs signals will transition depending on its inputs (S, R) and the raising edge on a clock. The values of its outputs will change only when 2 conditions are given.  if S &amp; R have values 0 &amp; 0 respectively the output (Q) has a value Q(t) which is the value that had before. if S &amp; R have values 0 &amp; 1 respectively the output (Q) has a value 0. if S &amp; R have values 1 &amp; 0 respectively the output (Q) has a value 1.But there's a case that should be avoided and is when both S &amp; R have values of 1.2. J K Flip-Flop:It behaves similarly as the SR Flip-Flop but with the difference that when the inputs J &amp; K have value 1, the output Q will be the opposite of the value that was before. then the rest of values are the same as the SR flip-flop.3. D Flip-Flop: This flip-flop has just one input, which makes the output Q to follow the input whenever the clock ticks.This transition tables are specifying the values of the output at the next raising edge of the clock, and keep in mind that they also remain constant at the all the other times."
----,"- Michael",comment,student,,"SR flip flop:S stands for Set and R stands for Reset. There are 3 inputs, S, R and Clock and 2 outputs Q and Q bar. The avoided value is to not let S and R be both 1 since it will produce unknown value.The other type of flip flop will be the J, K and CLock for inputs, Q and Q bar for outputs. This flip flop type allows both to have value 1 for J and K and will result in Q(t) bar. The last flip flop type is the easiest where there is only 2 inputs D and Clock with 2 outputs Q and Q bar."
