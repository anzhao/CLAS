00:02:22,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"relevance of what we teach to real life","I agree with the idea that traditional subjects such as literature, history and science can offer valuable insights into real-life. This was one of the points that came up in our group discussion as a ""good learning experience"", if it had relevance to real-life. We as teachers have to ensure we are educating/designing curriculum in this way."
00:01:05,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"essentially deep learning","""Educating for large understandings that can help us code for the unexpected"" Essentially if our students are deep learners (because we have designed our course and taught that way) they should be able to adapt their knowledge to situations that we can't predict yet."
00:01:12,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",annotation,student,"90% of what we typically teach is a waste of time","I agree with Vidhya, it's hard to believe that 90% of an engineering or science course is a waste of time. But if I think about my next lecture, then maybe the best I can hope for is that students retain 10% of it, in some form or another depending on what's relevant to them. I think this does come back to what we teach having relevance to real-life and to the future."
----,"Sacha Stelzer-Braid",comment,student,,"Perkins says essentially that because we don't know what will happen in the future, we have to teach our students in such a way that they will be able to cope/adapt with what might come up. This is through deep learning, through teaching for ""large understandings that can help us code the unexpected"". For me, this has provoked me to think about what I'm teaching in my next lecture and the way I teach it."

00:00:57,"Susan Green",annotation,student,"what might come up - code the unexpected","I like the idea about what might come up and how we deal with the unexpected.  I like to have the flexibility within my courses to be able to address the learning needs of my students rather than having to teach per-determine curriculum."
00:01:56,"Susan Green",annotation,student,"wide scope","I love the point about content and the need to also look outside of our the discipline area - to involved our students lives in what we teach and how we teach."
00:02:22,"Susan Green",annotation,student,"speak to the lives that people live","I think this is essential - if we want students to engage with what we are teaching, then we have to make what we teach realistic to the lives in which our students and society live at this point of time."

00:01:11,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,"90% of what we teach is a waste of time","""...90% of what we teach is a waste of time..."" - Is it the same 90% from the point of view of every student? If not, then this is unavoidable and perhaps acceptable isn't it?Also, is the 90% required to understand or provide a context for remaining 10%?I find it hard to accept that 90% of the stuff taught (in an engineering program)  is useless."
00:02:02,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,"Wide scope vs narrow depth","Are understanding of wide scope and narrow deep pieces of knowledge two ends of a spectrum? Is it possible to truly understand wide scope without in depth knowledge to back it up? How can a balance be struck - This is perhaps key to coming up with a good curriculum?"
00:00:55,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",annotation,student,"Education for the unknown","Yes, education should cater to the known and the unknown and yes this means training to be nimble and deal with new information and knowledge that might come up in the future. But, how does that translate to what should be taught in the present? Focus on how to ask the right questions? and how to answer these questions? Train students to apply the scientific method in all topics?"
----,"Vidhyasaharan Sethu",comment,student,"Improving the curriculum","The premise is that it is important to teach for the known and the unknown. I agree with this.It then suggests that 90% of what is currently taught is a waste of time because they are narrow deep pieces of knowledge - doesn't the understanding of the fundamentals of any field require large amounts of deep knowledge? These fundamentals would be critical for dealing with the unknown I think. Or is the argument for replacing the 90% with better in depth coverage of topics?The question then is, how should t"

00:00:33,"Lucas Lixinski",annotation,student,,"I understand the point of ""what's worth learning for present times and the next 20-30 years"", in the sense that we should be thinking about what knowledge does, and how it is presented. But I am also wary of the risk that this question is too easily translated into ""what's marketable now?"", and cutting-edge, somewhat narrow skill-centric education takes the lead, leaving foundational knowledge experiences behind."

----,"Sue Williamson",comment,student,"'Coding the unexpected'","Perkins makes some good points, including how we need to teach for 'wide scope', so areas will be relevant for 20, 30 years. He argues there is too much focus on methods and curriculum and not enough on teaching broadly. These points resonate with me as the best lecturer I ever had introduced the subject by saying he was going to teach us how to understand the area and how to navigate through the subject matter, rather than focusing strictly on content. In this way we could teach ourselves forever. I also agree with Perkin's statements about disciplines - my area crosses over several disciplines and I'll think more about these linkages and how I might weave them together more coherently."
