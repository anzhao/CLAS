00:02:50,"Claire Launchbury",annotation,student,,"INteresting to include discussion in large-scale lecture format...."
----,"Marcus De Leeuw",comment,student,,"Main thing which I recognize is the relation between process and content whereby the process is at least as important as the content. To keep students engaged you most come up with new formats and enable identification and discussion. It is very time-consuming because you always need to come up with new clips, discussion questions and learning formats."
----,"Ali Akbar Nezhad",comment,student,"General Comments - Ali","The importance of process has been well-emphasized. The process is at least as important as the content and deserves great deal of attention. When implementing your planned process, it is very important to be flexible. Lecturers should not force the planned process.  Allowing students to own the discussion and contribute to the process enhances contribution and learning. Using a simple clip or example especially in the beginning of the lecture is an effective way to help students understand the key concepts, importance of the lecture and possible applications."
00:00:42,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"I like the workshop idea and flexibility in teaching. Also the idea of constantly trying new things and reacting to how the audience react to these things."
00:03:16,"Saskia De Klerk",annotation,student,,"Plan your activities and make sure it aligns with the outcomes and aims for the session and course in general. I find this important to remember in my course for the future. Very interesting."
----,"Saskia De Klerk",comment,student,,"I think the message I take from this is that you should plan your activities, but be flexible enough to adapt to the needs of the audience and the content. I like the idea of using some of the tools that you use in a workshop environment and adapting that to a large group. I think the use of examples and real life cases are good ways to engage the students and give them something topical to discuss. Overall insightful and a good example."
00:00:19,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"'effective process feeds content' - one is not useful without the other."
00:00:35,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of treating lectures like a workshop - it feels less authoritarian/hierarchical and more community-based."
00:01:17,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"This idea of being 'in tune' with the students sits well for me - sometimes lectures risk losing the audience, or at least leaving people behind. Getting feedback and participation along the way ensures that people can keep up and are on the same wavelength."
00:02:30,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"The casual style is great (walking and talking) but you would have to really know your content back to front, be able to ad lib and be confident in not referring to your notes."
00:03:00,"Zahra Stardust",annotation,student,,"I'm definitely a fan of audio visual materials to keep people awake and engaged!"
00:02:42,"Alex Baumber",annotation,student,,"I often take a similar approach but I tend to give more guidance in what I want them to discuss - and also tell them how long they have and what is expected when we stop the one-on-one discussion."
----,"Alex Baumber",comment,student,,"I like his lecturing style and attempt to do much of this myself. Partly it comes down to personality though. I wouldn't engage with the students in quite the same way as him. Also, I find videos and other discussion activities are helpful in stopping me from talking too much and slowing down the pace of the class, as I can often end up going too fast if I'm left alone up the front talking for too long..."
00:00:54,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Prof. Carabetta shows how he has become more conscious of his teaching practice. Whist at the beginning of his career as a lecturer his main focus was on content rather than on process, now he talks how he has moved from content to effective process, that means signicant learning. His lectures now look like large workshops and students seem to be directly involved. He feels more relaxed and seems to enjoy teaching more."
00:00:57,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"We can see the interactive nature of his workshop-like lectures, how he conducts discussions, asks for opinions, evaluates personal contributions and self-reflecions, etc"
00:03:04,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Incorporating Youtube significant videos to fuel discussion seems to be a very effective teaching strategy to motivate students. They feel free to express their own opinions in small groups, they learn to listen each others and to take in turns offering their personal contributes"
00:02:49,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"Prof. Carabetta underlines the fact that we all learn in a different way and that choosing an activity as simple as a youtube clip can represent a very good personalised learning experience"
00:03:11,"Rosa Scalzo",annotation,student,null,"He also advises that we should always have a back up actvity in case something gets wrong. He also points out the fact that we should be willing to take the risk of dealing with incertainty and stay cool in case we need to choose option B."

00:02:57,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of getting the students to briefly discuss things during the lecture. It gives the lecturer a break and brings back the students who might have stopped paying attention."
----,"Nirmani Wijenayake Gamachchige",comment,student,,"As a lecturer you have to be quite confident and know your material really well to do this. You need to be well prepared and as he said needs to have a backup if things don&rsquo;t work out. I think it might take a while for the students to get used to it because they aren&rsquo;t used to that kind of learning but if the lecturer keeps at it, students will start to enjoy it as well."
00:00:21,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Giuseppe claims that &lsquo;effective process feeds content&rsquo;. This is an interesting point. However, no matter how sophisticated the process happens to be, without having relevant and well-perceived content, it is utterly useless. I would probably say that having a good content permits the lecturer to work out novel, more engaging processes to present the lecture."
00:00:27,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Treating each lecture as a large workshop is an interesting idea. It may be useful with certain topics but I am unsure that it would be appropriate to deliver each and every lecture in this large workshop format."
00:00:47,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I like the idea of being relaxed and flexible. I agree that the communication with students benefits from this attitude; students will be less hesitant when asking questions or participating in the special activities."
00:01:34,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"I very much agree that having video (Youtube) samples in the lectures is a useful and powerful tool. It makes lectures more engaging."
00:03:24,"Zoltan Rusznak",annotation,student,,"Having a Plan B is an absolute must have if this type of lecturing is performed. One must have a contingency plan and perhaps revert back to the old-style lectures if students are not willing to participate in a way they should."
----,"Zoltan Rusznak",comment,student,,"Activity-like lectures are interesting, and they provide an alternative way to deliver lecture material. Although I do not think that this arrangement can be employed for each and every lecture, activity-like lectures certainly make the teaching process more exciting and engaging. Presenting Youtube or other demonstrative videos during the lectures is also an excellent technique to maintain students&rsquo; interest and ensure their active participation. Importantly, however, one must have a contingency plan to deal with the situation when students do not cooperate well enough."
00:00:21,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,"Effective process feeds content","""Effect process feeds content""...a good point. I think selecting and fine tuning the process has a number of variables to play with: the content, background of the students (both educations and cultural), and sometimes on may be any follow-up courses continuing in later years in the curriculum."
00:00:45,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Seminar-like activity-based lectures are really cool and it really helps to keep the audience with you till at the very end."
00:01:52,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Examples that can be related to personal experiences are more engaging."
00:02:45,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Group activities are always engaging, and as a student I really enjoy those. However, the content and limited time within the semester are always imposing constraints on implementing frequent group activities. In Electrical Engineering, mostly the lectures are accompanied by labs and tutorials, where group activities are frequently used. In this context, lectures are meant to squeeze a lot of content into 12-15 weeks, which makes it practically difficult to increase engagement."
00:03:21,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",annotation,student,,"Back-up options, a must to remember"
----,"Chamith Abewardana Wijenayake",comment,student,,"The video highlights about careful planning and selection of the right process for the content being taught, and also highlights activity-based seminar-like lectures with enhanced student engagement. Of course, such an approach requires a lot of preparation, back-up plans, and might need to compromise the content to find time."
