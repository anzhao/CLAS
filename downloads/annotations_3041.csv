00:00:27,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"What's worth learning?","I believe this is a two-fold approach: the fundamentals that the student needs to know and the 'extension' knowledge: I would view this more who to teach student to problem solve, to the think outside the box, feel comfortable to tackle unfamiliar material."
00:01:37,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"Learning for the unknown...","I find this interesting as to how we teach students to learn in 'nimble' ways. From my own experiences, I didn't really click with the problem solving nature of chemistry until my honours year where I was in a research lab full time. Having said that, I couldn't have done that without a good foundation that my undergraduate years. I think it is a hard line to walk of teaching and extending students at the same time."
00:02:27,"Samantha Furfari",annotation,student,"Problems with the system","I do find it a challenge to get students to understand that not everything that we teach is discipline specific, particularly in the broader context of science there is much overlap in the types of skills and knowledge that we want the students to learn."

----,"Corey Martin",comment,student,"General comment","The key ideas for my own teaching from the video are:1. Ensuring that what we teach now is relevant (to students and societies lives) and useful for the future whether it be the actual content or more importantly the process of learning;2. We need to be cautious of what material we include and more importantly exclude from a course;3. Teaching of material can be meaningless and a waste of time, thus it is important to review the relevance of material presented in a course;4. Beware of curriculum and administration as barriers to learning and teaching."
00:00:27,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"What's worth learning","What's worth learning. The question can be posed on two levels: (1) problem-solving skills versus knowledge of facts and (2) what to include in the curriculum."
00:01:02,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"Learning for the unkown","following on from the previous annotation: David is talking about learning problem solving skills rather than knowledge. I think the curriculum question is nevertheless equally important."
00:01:12,"Till Boecking",annotation,student,"90% waste of time","That may be true when viewed across once entire learning (at school, university, ..) but not necessarily for particular courses. Discsipline-specific knowledge is still required in many professions."
----,"Till Boecking",comment,student,"David Perkins Interview","Key ideas for my teaching:- consider your student group and why they are taking this class (what is relevant to them)- facilitate deep learning through choise of relevant content to equip students with a way of thinking/problem solving above and beyond the actual content"

What creates the resistance to change and innovation in learning? Is it the same across learning levels?

00:01:57,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",annotation,student,Claudio,"Teaching for understanding of wide scope"
----,"Claudio Cazorla Silva",comment,student,Claudio,"From this video I get two main ideas that I would like to apply to my teaching. First, is to teach for understanding the 'unknown'. This may sound a bit abstract but in fact it refers to a possible form of 'deep understanding'. If your students are able to come up with some new content that you did not explicitly mention during your lectures, but which somehow logically results from what you commented, is because they are not thinking superficially (which I think is great!). And second, is to teach while having in mind 'wider scopes'. In my opinion, this is related to the ability of turning learning into a functional skill. We go to university and specialize in very specific fields; however, when out of the academic environment we still need to solve problems, understand complicate relations, anticipate reactions, etc. In some way, both notes that I have taken are intimately related to the concept of how to promote a 'deep' understanding."
00:00:35,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,,
00:00:59,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,Omar,"Educating for the unknown --&gt; good point but for that to happen first you need to know the known first. Similar to vulnerability and resilience in Risk management. You want to develop resilience (unknowns) but for you to achieve that you need to first have a good system that reduces vulnerability (from known events)."
00:02:12,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,Omar,"this can be done if the subject is not a core one."
00:02:13,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,Omar,"Good point being made here and which relates to the discussion yesterday in FULT of moving from Surface to deep learning. I do that in my teaching where students are taught the concepts but the assignment given is a practical one in which they need to apply the knowledge learned to propose a solution."
00:02:28,"Omar Hussain",annotation,student,OMar,"Very good point and David mentions it is a very challenging point. How can that be addressed? Want to know more!"
----,"Omar Hussain",comment,student,,"My summary after watching the video is:1. My key question would be how to make the curriculum of my course (that is very important in day to day activities) so that it is broad and not just explains the details?2. Most of my students are encouraged to do deep learning by using their assignments. Put in to practice what they have learned in the class in the assignments. Students who do deep learning are able to demonstrate their ability to solve some real world problems. 3. Case studies in tutorials. Assignments etc."

00:02:01,"Maria Veronica Chandra-Hioe",annotation,student,,"teaching contents that gives understanding of a wide scope"
----,"Takuya Kojima",comment,student,Takuya,"a. What is more important than learning the contents for exams is learning how to contextualise the knowledge and apply it to various situations.b. They explore more expressions in their own context. They can build more expressions on what they have learnt for their own communication purpose in classrooms and outside classrooms.c. Knowledge is presented in a way that students can make it relevant to their own life and other disciplines."
00:00:41,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I agree. There are important global issues in the world today that could be translated into a totally new university curriculum altogether from the fairly traditional subjects that are still being taught every year. We need to keep up to speed with the world's pressing issues."
00:01:28,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"I don't agree with this completely. In courses such as the ones pertaining to Media Studies (which I teach) there are a lot of important concepts, theories and practical examples that are being taught to students. And these are accompanied by relevant and engaging type of assignments, which are industry-related. What is often missing, however, are some of the new angles that the industry is taking. The media industry is changing so fast and so much, that is hard to stay up to date even for lecturers. Students are often more knowledgeable than us when it comes to certain media practices, and they loose their interest when they see these are not (yet) incorporated in the discussion."
00:02:08,"Valentina Bau",annotation,student,,"This is a key challenge in our teaching practice, and one that we must prepare for. We are often constrained by a course structure that is already in place (and has been for a number of years perhaps) and, personally, I am not sure whether and how I should step out of it."
----,"Valentina Bau",comment,student,,"I believe that the university curriculum should stay abreast of contemporary global issues that go behind the traditional frameworks we are used to apply to university courses.If teaching is connected to both a theoretical and practical discussion that students can regard as relevant to their present and future daily lives, a deep approach to learning will occur naturally."

00:02:08,"Julia Lappin",annotation,student,"the ways in which the discipline looks outside itself",
----,"Julia Lappin",comment,student,,"I found the interview with David Perkins form Harvard thought-provoking and it resonated for me a lot. The points I particularly highlighted were:i) nimble ways of thinking about...the expected and the unexpected- this is a recognition that the world is constantly evolving and that the demands of society shift over time: how students expect to be taught; what knowledge we need to hold in our heads rather than be able to look up; and -for me, in Medicine- the idea that illnesses belong to a time. As new cures are found, there is a need to prioritise learning about how to find new cures for new diseases, and a shift from treating acute illness to more chronic conditions.  ii)understanding of wide scope - the applicability of ideas and concepts is increasingly relevantiii) the ways in which the discipline looks outside itself - this is an important idea- that we need to learn from other disciplines about advances in their fields in order to enrich advances in our own."
00:02:44,"Mariam Farida",annotation,student,"teaching discourse","i find what David Perkins is suggesting very interesting, as often when i was an undergraduate student, i used to ask how will i use all the subject i have studied back then will help em in my day to day tasks. 1- who eventually determines whats worth learning? i science more prominent than philosophy? i think a student should be able to develop a critical understanding and appreciation to general knowledge by learning about life in general, that involves science and social studies..etc.2- i don't agree with the speaker that all what is being used now is 90% inaccurate. on what basis is it irrelevant? what is the alternative?"
----,"Mariam Farida",comment,student,"teaching discourse","i found what the speaker suggests is very striking and it needs more research to understand what the speaker suggests as an alternative to the current system of teaching. but i think that one can develop an understanding to Life when one learns about different aspects of it. such as learning content and its relation to the era or times we live in now. for example, i teach a language course, and i see important correlation between learning foreign language to keep up with the needs of the current times."
00:01:25,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,"90% of what we typically teach is a waste of time","While I don't think students need to recall 90% of what we teach, I believe that much of what we teach contributes to building students' capacities to think critically. So while the content might not need to be recalled, if it is used to demonstrate and apply concepts in the real world and build capacity then it is still useful.Despite holding on to most of my university notes, I have probably looked back over less than 1% of them."
00:01:57,"Sonia Graham",annotation,student,"understandings of wide scope",
----,"Sonia Graham",comment,student,,"This video relates to the reading I did of chapter 2 of Biggs and Tang (2007) that differentiates between thinking of what students are, versus what teachers do, versus what students do. It seems to me that what Perkins is talking about links relates to what students do. How can we get them to engage with content in a way that enables them to learn skills that will be useful for them in an unknowable future. Deep learning in my area means students learning how to conduct research and find resources to help them address whatever policy context they are faced with in their working lives. The main course I am teaching involves students learning by doing, therefore there is very little traditional lecturing, but rather seminars that operate like extended tutorials so that students have the opportunity to learn together with guidance and support from academic staff. I believe students need to be passionate about what they are studying. It is for this reason that in my course I've given them opportunities to shape their projects to meet their own interests, yet still challenging them to read beyond the bounds of what they would have read to date in their degree. It has been rewarding to see some students embrace this and find that what initially seemed like an irrelevant topic to them can be interesting and engaging."

----,"Julie Thoms",comment,student,,"I think that they key idea here is determining what exactly is worth learning, since a large amount of content being taught is probably irrelevant to the student. We need to be teaching students not only the foundational knowledge required for their discipline (which for some will be quite substantial), but also how they can go about finding  and evaluating the content they require in the future."

00:01:12,"Sanja Lujic",annotation,student,"Current teaching","90% is a waste of time - I disagree with this. Most of first year courses are foundation ones, and they are the building blocks of what's to come. In the later years, and dependant on the program, there might be relevance to most of the content that we learn. In my area, statistics, most of the methods we learnt are applicable in the industry, and graduates feel skilled knowing they were exposed to a variety of methods during their years of schooling."
00:01:56,"Sanja Lujic",annotation,student,"Applicability of content","I concur that we should be teaching bearing in mind where our content fits in the greater scheme of things. As educators, we should be aware of how pieces of puzzle come together during the student's education pathway. We should be broadening our horizons and drawing analogies in wider areas. This will help students understand the relevance and importance of the subject - and hopefully engage them in deeper learning practices."
00:02:09,"Sanja Lujic",annotation,student,"Area wide connections","How does the discipline relate to others? Will help guide conversations and stimulate deeper learning."
----,"Margarita Mandic",comment,student,,"Key points:-It is worth looking into curriculum often and update it to reflect changes, new trends, developments. New fresh content that will equip students with up to date skills and knowledge.-Majority of students that I teach follow guidelines that are given to them. More deep learning would involve looking at case studies, how and where different methodologies can be applied ( Ergonomics course).-Deep learning will happen if there is an interest in a particular class. Interest arises from content, methods of presentation and presenter themselves."
----,"Sanja Lujic",comment,student,,"We should move past our own subject silos and have an integrated/cohesive/wide-reaching purpose for teaching the content we propose or do. Transcending our our subject areas is the key in keeping the students engaged, interested and highlighting the importance of interconnectedness between the content taught during their degree."
